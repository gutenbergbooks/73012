_My very dear friend_,

THOUGH I have had no answer to my last, yet I suppose it hath reached
your hands, and I am glad to hear that ♦_Ephrata_ plantation is in some
degree opened, and thereby a preparation made for a future progress
this spring. Mr. _Fox_ not coming, and going upon lumber, hath been a
great loss to my poor family, but I hope ere now all is settled, and
the sawing carried on with vigour. That seems to be the thing which
providence points out at present, and as so many negroes are ready, it
will be a pity that _Bethesda_ should not do something, as well as the
neighbouring planters. If it was not that I am erecting a large place
for public worship, eighty feet square, and am called to preach to so
many thousands in various places, I would come over immediately myself.
But perhaps it will be best to stay till the new Governor is appointed
and embarks, or at least to come a little before him. I hear that
Colonel _Vanderdison_ will in all probability be the man; they are
determined I find to have a military person. With this, I send your
brother a power to dispose of _Providence_ plantation, and I hope to
hear shortly that Doctor _B――――_, with your assistance, hath purchased
more negroes,――My dear friend, do exert yourself a little for me in
this time of my absence, and I trust the Orphan-house affairs will
shortly be so ordered, that none shall be troubled about its affairs,
but my own domestics. As _Nathaniel P――――_ is so willing, and hath
hitherto behaved so faithfully, I have sent him a full power in
conjunction with Mrs. _W――――_ to act under you. The man and woman that
bring this, are with their son indented to me, and I have an excellent
school mistress and a young student, engaged to come over shortly. Ere
long, I suppose we shall have a large family. LORD grant it may be a
religious one! I would have nothing done in respect to the building,
besides repairing the piazza, and what else is absolutely necessary,
till I come. Perhaps I may bring a carpenter along with me, who will
stay some years. I cannot tell what can induce me to take care of a
place, where the gospel is so little regarded, unless it be a principle
of faith. Surely it will not always be so. What difference is there
between _Georgia_, and several parts of _England_? Here thousands
and ten thousands run, and ride miles upon miles to hear the gospel.
――There――but I do not love to think of it. O my dear friend, whatever
others do, may you and your houshold serve the LORD! I see there is no
happiness, but in keeping near to JESUS CHRIST.――But this prosperity,
――this worldly mindedness,――how many fools hath it destroyed; how many
of GOD’s own children hath it awfully bewildered! May the LORD keep
all my dear friends clear of this dangerous rock! My love to all. How
is Mr. _V――――_? Pray do your utmost to bring about a reconciliation
between him and Mr. _B――――_. I could give several particular and
powerful reasons; at present I can add no more. My dear friend, pray
for us, and exert yourself for _Bethesda_; _Bethesda_’s GOD will richly
reward you.

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

IT gives me pain, when any of your Ladyship’s letters lie by me
unanswered,――I would always write immediately if I could. For many
days I have been much engaged, but can now refrain no longer. Your
Ladyship’s letter was immediately forwarded to _Philadelphia_.――It will
be an acceptable present to the good old Governor. I wish Mr. _T――――_
may not make too great compliances,――but I fear instability is his weak
side. I have not heard from _South Audley Street_, since I wrote last
to your Ladyship.――The _Moravian_’s outward scheme, I am apt to believe
will soon be disconcerted. Strange! Why will GOD’s children build
_Babels_? Why will they flatter themselves, that GOD owns and approves
of them, because he suffers them to build high? In mercy to them, such
buildings, of whatever kind, must come down. I hope our new-intended
tabernacle is not of this nature. It would have pleased your Ladyship,
to have seen how willingly the people gave last LORD’s day. At seven in
the morning we collected fifty pounds, in the evening one hundred and
twenty-six pounds. Blessed be GOD, we have now near nine hundred pounds
in hand. He that hath begun, I trust will enable us to go on, and bring
out the top-stone, shouting Grace! Grace! Our LORD still continues to
work in our old despised place. I trust it hath been a _Bethel_ to many,
many souls. This your Ladyship knows may be any where. _Clifton_’s a
_Bethel_ when GOD is there. That your Ladyship may enjoy more and more
of the divine presence, and increase with all the increase of GOD, is
the continual prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I HAVE two of your kind letters lying by me unanswered.――I am not
usually so dilatory, but business and bodily weakness have prevented
me. At present, I have a cold and fever upon me, but I preach on,
hoping one day or another to die in my work. One Mr. _Steward_, a dear
minister of CHRIST, that began to be popular in the church, entered
into his rest last week. I saw him just before he expired. Methinks I
hear him say, “Love CHRIST more, and serve him better.” O that I may do
so in earnest! For indeed my obligations increase continually. We have
had a blessed winter. Many have been added to our flock.――Next week I
intend, GOD willing, to lay the first brick of our new tabernacle. I
am now looking up for direction about my removal.――Which are the best
seasons for the north? I should be glad to know speedily. Have you
the first account you wrote of your conversion? Or have you leisure to
draw up a short narrative of the rise and progress of the work of GOD
in your parts? A dear christian minister in _Scotland_, is about to
publish two volumes, relative to the late awakenings in various places.
Such things should be transmitted to posterity; in heaven all will
be known. Thanks be to GOD that there is such a rest remaining for
his dear people. I am too impatient to get at it. But who can help
longing to see JESUS? What but a hope and prospect of furthering his
glorious gospel, can reconcile us to this _aceldama_, this wide howling
wilderness? If we had not our beloved to lean on, what should we do?
Go on, my dear Sir, in his strength; I wish you much, yea very much
prosperity. The LORD bless you, and all the dear souls in your parts,
with all spiritual blessings. I am glad you have received the books.
♦I am now publishing two more sermons, and a small collection of hymns
for public worship. _Benedictus benedicat et benedicentur._ I commend
you and all to his never-failing mercy, and myself to your continual
prayers, as being, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                             _London, March 3, 1753._

_My dear Friend_,

I THANK you and your brother most heartily for the loan of the chapel.
Blessed be GOD, the work goes on well.――On _Thursday_ morning, the
first brick of our new tabernacle was laid with awful solemnity.
I preached from _Exodus_ the twentieth, and the latter part of the
twenty-fourth verse; “In all places where I record my name, I will come
unto thee and bless thee.” Afterwards we sung, and prayed for GOD’s
blessing in all places, where his glorious name is recorded. The wall
is now about a yard high. The building is to be eighty feet square.
It is upon the old spot. We have purchased the house, and if we finish
what we have begun, shall be rent-free for forty-six years. We have
above eleven hundred pounds in hands. This I think is the best way
to build. Mr. _Steward_’s death so affected me, that when I met the
workman that night to contract about the building, I could scarce bear
to think of building tabernacles. Strange! that so many should be so
soon discharged, and we continued! Eighteen years have I been waiting
for the coming of the son of GOD; but I find we are immortal till our
work is done. O that we may never live to be ministered unto, but to
minister! Mr. _Steward_ spoke for his LORD as long as he could speak at
all. He had no clouds nor darkness. I was with him, till a few minutes
before he slept in JESUS. I have good news from several parts; a door
is opening at _Winchester_. Surely the little leaven will ferment, till
the whole kingdom be leavened. Even so, LORD JESUS, Amen! Pray how does
our elect Lady? I hope to write to her Ladyship next post. Joint love
attends you and yours, and your brother and his houshold.――That all may
increase with all the increase of GOD, is still the earnest prayer of,
my dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER ♦DCCCCLXIX.


                            _To Mr. M――――._

                                            _London, March 10, 1753._

_My dear Mr. M――――_,

I AM glad you have had such good times. I was grieved that Mr. _E――――_
was taken from _London_, because Mr. _M――――_ was taken ill, and a
carnal preacher put up in his room. But GOD’s thoughts are not as our
thoughts. Let this consideration reconcile you to my not preaching
at Mr. _B――――_’s. I went as far as Mrs. _S――――_’s, but so many things
occurred, that I went no further. You may hear more when we meet again.
I have preached at _Spitalfields_ chapel twice. Both the Mr. _W――――_s
are agreed, as the younger brother writes me word, in answer to my
letter. Let brotherly love continue! I do not like writing against
any body, but I think, that wisdom which dwells with prudence, should
direct you not to fill Mr. _W――――s_ people (who expect you will
serve them) with needless jealousies. He that believeth doth not make
haste.――I therefore wait, being assured of this, that every plant which
our heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted out. I hope to
see the time, when you will talk less of persons and things, and more
of Him, who is the common head of his whole mystical body. This, and
this alone can make and keep you steady in yourself, and extensively
useful to others. I am glad you know when persons are justified. It is
a lesson I have not yet learnt. There are so many stony-ground hearers
that receive the word with joy, that I have determined to suspend my
judgment, till I know the tree by its fruits. You will excuse this
freedom. I love you with a disinterested love, I only wish you may
be happy in JESUS. This will make you see things with new eyes, and
give you such a freedom of heart as is unspeakable, and full of glory.
For the present I must bid you adieu. That the LORD of all Lords may
confirm, strengthen, stablish, and settle you in his love, is the
earnest prayer of, my dear Mr. _M――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                            _London, March 21, 1753._

_My very dear friend_,

BY last _Monday_’s waggon there was sent a box of books. May the
Redeemer own and bless what is sent in it! Then all will be well. I
know your prayers will not be wanting. I am glad you have found out
another thief, that lay hid in the chambers of imagery, which are in
your heart. Time and temptation will draw out ten thousand more, which
as yet, you know nothing of. Happy they, who can discover, pluck out,
and cut off their right hand and right eye corruptions. This must be
done, or we shall only take up with the bare semblance of holiness.
The Redeemer must sit as a refiner’s fire upon our hearts, or we shall
never be purified as gold or silver. This is our comfort, when we are
tried we shall come forth like gold. The offences that we meet with
in the church, are most trying;――therefore they are permitted to come.
I wish my dear Mr. _G――――_, as well as yourself, may learn experience
from what hath happened, and never run yourselves into needless
difficulties. What is happening to the _Moravians_ is no more than
I have long expected, and spoken of to many friends. Their scheme is
so _antichristian_ in almost every respect, that I am amazed the eyes
of the _English_ brethren have not long since been opened, and the
_Babel_ stopt at the first. But the glorious GOD generally suffers such
buildings to go high, that their fall may be more conspicuous. May the
builders rise (I mean as to spirituals) by their falls, and gain by
their losses! That is all the harm I wish them. My dear man, what a
blessed thing it is to live and walk in the simplicity of the gospel!
How happy is that man, who being neither fond of money, numbers, nor
power, goes on day by day without any other scheme, than a general
intention to promote the common salvation amongst people of all
denominations. Will you pray that I may be thus minded? I cease not
to pray for you and yours, and my other dear friends at _Leeds_; and
I would set out immediately for the north, was I not obliged to be
here in about two months, to attend and give further orders about our
building. But some time in the summer――What?――I hope to see the fields
white, ready unto harvest again, and to rejoice together with you in
our common LORD.――In the mean while, let us be busy for so blessed a
Master, and be continually pressing forward towards the mark for the
prize of our high calling. The LORD JESUS say Amen! Adieu. With joint
love to all, I subscribe myself, my dear friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Norwich, April 17, 1753._

_Dear Mr. G――――_,

IT hath given me concern, that your letter, with Mr. _D――――_’s and Miss
_A――――_’s, have lain by me so long unanswered. Business, and not want
of love, hath prevented my writing. Was it not sinful, I could wish for
a thousand hands, a thousand tongues, and a thousand lives: all should
be employed night and day, without ceasing, in promoting the glory of
the ever-lovely, ever-loving JESUS. Thanks be to his great name for
reviving his work in the midst of the years. I trust that his people
every where will be made to sing, “The Winter is past, the rain is over
and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, and the voice of the turtle
is heard in the land.” All things promise well at _London_; and I hope
you will yet see greater things than ever in the _North_. Some time
this Summer I hope to see you all again. In the mean while, you must
not fail to pray for me. I must now begin to enter upon my Spring
circuit. For these three days past, I have been preaching here twice
a-day. In the mornings we have been quiet, but in the evenings the sons
of _Belial_ have been somewhat rude. The place built here for public
worship, is much larger than yours at _Newcastle_; and, I believe,
hundreds of truly awakened souls attend. What cannot GOD do? What will
the end of this be? The destruction of _Jericho_.――The rams-horns must
go round, till her tow’ring walls fall down. Who would but be one of
these rams-horns? My dear Sir, let us not be ashamed of the cross of
CHRIST: it is lined with love, and will ere long be exchanged for a
crown. JESUS himself will put it on our heads. I am called away, and
therefore cannot enlarge. To-morrow, GOD willing, I return to _London_,
and hope soon to get time to answer my other _Newcastle_ correspondents.
In the mean while, pray remember me to them and all in the most cordial
manner, and beg them never, never to cease praying for, my dear Sir,

                Their and your most affectionate friend
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Norwich, April 18, 1753._

_My very dear Friend_,

HOW does GOD delight to exceed even the hopes, and to disappoint
the fears of his weak, though honest-hearted people! In spite of all
opposition, he hath caused us to triumph even in _Norwich_. Thousands
attend twice every day, and hear with the greatest eagerness. I hope
it will appear yet more and more, that GOD hath much people here. I
am greatly importuned to stay over Lord’s-day, but I hope to be in
_Spitalfields_ on _Saturday_ evening, and to spend the holydays in
_London_. O that they may prove glorious days of the Son of Man! Thanks
be to GOD, it is the christian’s privilege to keep holyday all the year
round. “CHRIST, our passover, is sacrificed for us,” and we are called
to keep a perpetual feast. Happy, happy they, who know what it is to
banquet on the love of JESUS. Surely it passeth all understanding. Of
this happiness, you and yours have been made partakers. What need have
we then to cry out, “What shall we render unto the LORD for all his
mercies!” O my dear Sir, let us keep close to our loving LORD, and
not suffer the noise and hurry of business, to rob us of one moment’s
communion and fellowship with the ever-blessed GOD. I commend you both
to his never-failing mercy; and wishing you, from my inmost soul, the
very best of blessings, even the sure mercies of _David_, I subscribe
myself, my dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCLXXIII.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                            _London, April 27, 1753._

_Dear Sir_,

ON _Saturday_ evening a never-failing Redeemer brought me safe to
_London_, where I have been indisposed ever since. But I shall little
regard the weakness and indisposition of my body, if I can but have
the pleasure of hearing, if not before, yet at the great day, that
good was done to one precious soul at _Norwich_. Blessed be GOD for
the seed sown there. I doubt not but it will be watered with the dew
of his heavenly blessing, and bring forth a divine increase. O that it
may spring up, and bear fruit abundantly in the heart of you and yours!
My poor prayers shall not be wanting in your behalf. This is the only
return I can make to you both, for the great kindnesses conferred on me
at your house. You know who hath promised, “That a cup of cold water,
given for his name’s sake, shall not lose its reward.” What a Saviour
is this! Who would but love and serve him! Surely his service is
perfect freedom! I hope all my dear _Norwich_ friends will find it so
every day. Be pleased to salute them all most affectionately, as they
come in your way. I trust they will remember me at the throne of grace.
You all know my name: I am the chief of sinners, and less than the
least of all saints, but

                    Their and your obliged friend,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCLXXIV.


                                               _London, May 1, 1753._

_My dear David_,

DO you enquire where I am? I answer, in _London_, longing to come to
_Leeds_, and yet withheld hitherto by His providence who ordereth all
things well. Let us have a little more patience, and then in a few
weeks I hope to have a blessed range in the _North_. GOD’s time I
have always found to be the best time in the end. Ere now, I suppose,
Mr. _L――――_ hath received my letter from _Norwich_. The word ran and
was glorified there. Preaching so frequently, and riding hard, almost
killed me; but what is my body in comparison of precious and immortal
souls? O that this Spring may prove a Spring-time every day! Indeed
I want to begin to begin to do something for JESUS. At present I am
engaged in a very ungrateful work; I mean, in writing against the
leading _Moravian_ brethren. When you see it, you will know whether
there was not a cause: a second edition of the pamphlet is just come
out. I fear the third part of the Journals cannot be procured: perhaps
it is not much matter. I am sick of all I do, and stand astonished that
the Redeemer still continues to make use of and bless me. Surely I am
more foolish than any man; no one receives so much, and does so little.
If you was here, we would weep together: friends know what it is to
exchange hearts. May the common friend of sinners keep both our hearts
near himself, and then all will be well. I cannot think of _Leeds_
without weeping. I love that people, and pray that they may increase
with all the increase of GOD. “Brethren, pray for us,” is still the
earnest request of my poor heart. I am weaker than the weakest, less
than the least of all. Write to me; I do not like your sending such
round-about ways: friends letters always pay postage. O let us send
often by post to heaven; I mean, on the wings of faith and love: from
thence we shall assuredly receive good answers, though not always in
our own way or time. For the present, farewel. My hearty love to all
the true followers of the Lamb. I hope to write to all in time. In
great haste, but much greater love, I subscribe myself,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLXXV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                      _Haverford-west, May 27, 1753._

_My dear Man_,

THOUGH my wife hath not sent me the letter, yet she writes me, “That
you have sent me a threatening one.” I thank you for it, though unseen,
and say unto thee, if thou art thus minded, “What thou doest, do
quickly.” Blessed be GOD, I am ready to receive the most traiterous
blow, and to confess before GOD and man, all my weaknesses and failings,
whether in public or private life. I laid my account of such treatment,
before I published my expostulatory letter.――And your writing in
such a manner, convinces me more and more, that _Moravianism_ leads
us to break through the most sacred ties of nature, friendship, and
disinterested love. But my wife says you write, “That _I am drunk with
power and approbation_.” Wast thou with me so long, my dear man, and
hast thou known me no better? What power didst thou know me ever to
grasp at? Or what power am I now invested with? None, that I know of,
except that of being a poor pilgrim. And as for approbation, GOD knows,
I have had little else besides the cross to glory in, since my first
setting out.――May that be my glory still! But my wife says you write,
“That I promised not to print.” I remember no such thing. I know you
advised me not to do so, but I know of no promise made. If I remember,
I had not then read _Rimius_; but after that, I both heard and saw so
many things, that I could not, with a safe conscience, be silent. My
wife says likewise, that you write, “The bulk of my letter is not
truth.” So says Mr. _Peter B――――_; nay, he says, “that all is a lie:”
and I hear he declares so in the pulpit. So that whether I will or
not, he obliges me to clear myself in print; and if he goes on in this
manner, will not only constrain me to print a third edition, but also
to publish the dreadful heap that lies behind. My answers to him, the
Count, and my old friend _H――――_, are almost ready. I cannot send them
this post, but may have time ere long. O my dear man, let me tell thee,
that the GOD of truth and love hates lies: and that cause can never
be good, which needs equivocations and falshoods to support it. GOD
willing, you shall have none from me. I have naked truth. I write out
of pure love: and the LORD JESUS only knows, what unspeakable grief and
pain I feel, when I think how many of my dear friends have so involved
themselves. If any thing stops my pen, it will be concern for them, not
myself. I value neither name, nor life itself, when the cause of GOD
calls me to venture both. Thanks be to his great name, I can truly say,
that for these many years last past, no sin hath had dominion over me;
neither have I slept with the guilt of any known, unrepented sin lying
upon my heart: if you will tell me of any, I will be obliged to you. In
the mean while, I wish thee well in body and soul, and subscribe myself,
my dear _John_,

                Your very affectionate, though injured,
                       friend for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCLXXVI.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                              _Newman, June 2, 1753._

DO not think that I have forgotten either you or yours, or my promise
of writing to you. Travelling and preaching have prevented me. Within
a little more than a fortnight, I have rode three hundred and fifty
miles, and preached above twenty times: with what success the great day
will discover. Then we shall know who are stony-ground hearers, and who
receive the word into honest and good hearts. At _Narboth_, _Pembroke_,
_Haverford-west_, &c. congregations were large; and a gracious melting
seemed to be among the people. Nature now cries out for a little ease,
but faith says, “It is now just time to begin to begin.” Perhaps you
may hear me preach next _Thursday_ evening. _London_ people attract
me much. O that our hearts may be more and more drawn towards JESUS!
I hope this will find you (like the impression of my seal) with your
soul winged for heaven, and this poor, earthly, good-for-nothing world,
under your feet. Could I fly away, you should never see me till we meet
at the right hand of GOD. There the wicked, and even my own mother’s
children, nay my spiritual children, will cease from troubling me, and
my weary soul will enjoy an everlasting rest. I can now no more. I am
baiting at an inn not far from _Gloucester_, hoping shortly to see you
and yours grown in grace; and begging all your dear relations to accept
hearty love, I subscribe myself, my dear, dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, June 8, 1753._

_My very dear Friend_,

I WAS glad, at my return from a late excursion, to find a letter from
you, especially as it bespoke your heart to be nearer than usual to the
ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. May this intimacy increase daily, and
the fruits of it appear in your abounding in every good word and work!
I find more and more, that one’s whole life ought to be a continued
sacrifice of love. I am glad Mr. _R――――_ is owned. This gives me hopes,
that he begins to preach as when he first set out, and as he told a
friend, a little before his embarking, “that he hoped he should.” It
never went better with his heart than then. GOD keep him and all from
further entanglements by fleshly wisdom and worldly policy! which I
think have nothing to do with the work of the LORD. Mr. _S――――_ can
tell you what concern the _B――――n_’s awful conduct hath given me.
Surely if the Redeemer had not supported me, I should within these two
months have died with grief. But I will say no more:――JESUS knows all
things. He will not long bear with guile. You know my temper. The LORD
help me in simplicity and godly sincerity to have my conversation in
the world, and in the church! By this time twelvemonth (if in the land
of the dying) I hope to see you. In the mean while, let Mr. _S――――_
speak. I hope he hath succeeded to his wishes; and I pray earnestly
that the GOD of the seas and of the dry land, may bring him safe to the
desired haven. Ere long we shall all arrive, I trust, in _Abraham_’s
harbour; from thence we shall never put out to sea any more. There the
wicked world, and even GOD’s own children, will cease from troubling,
and our weary souls enjoy an everlasting rest. May you and yours
enter with a full gale! Let us write to, though we cannot as yet see
each other. Our hearty love and respects await Mr. _P――――_, and all
enquiring friends. I am glad to hear Mr. _T――――_ is coming over with
Mr. _D――――_. If they come with their old fire, I trust they will be
enabled to do wonders. I and Messrs. _W――――_’s are very friendly. I
like them, because they go out and let the world see what they are at
once; I suspect something wrong, when so much secrecy is required. But
I must have done. Only let me tell you, that the Redeemer still owns my
feeble labours. I have been a circuit of about 700 miles, and preached
to many thousands. My body yet is upheld, and my soul rejoices in GOD
my Saviour. Help me, help me to praise him. I thank you for what you
have done for Mr. _H――――_, and for all past favours. That grace, mercy
and peace may be multiplied upon you and yours, every day and hour, is
the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I HAVE been unaccountably detained in _London_ longer than I expected,
but am just now setting out for _Portsmouth_. However, I cannot
help sending your Ladyship the inclosed. It hath set me at liberty,
and fully convinced me, against what a disguised spirit I have been
testifying. At present, I shall go on in my old way, preaching the
everlasting gospel. Blessed be GOD, it is successful here. We had
a most glorious sacrament last _Sunday_ in our new Tabernacle; the
Master of the feast was with us of a truth. As I purpose returning
from _Portsmouth_ next _Tuesday_, I should think myself highly honoured
by receiving a few lines from your Ladyship. May this find you in the
blissful enjoyment of him, who I am persuaded is your Ladyship’s all
in all! I can only add, that words cannot well express how much I am,
ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

FROM _April_ to near _July_, is a long time for a kind letter to lie by
unanswered; but necessity hath no law. A great variety of circumstances
hath occurred lately to prevent my corresponding with you, and many
other dear friends. Some time next month perhaps you may be acquainted
with them. I have thoughts of seeing _Edinburgh_ then, though I
must push hard to bring it about. I purpose at my return, to stay
in _London_ but one night, and then set out for the _North_. O for a
gracious gale of divine influence! The sacred wind hath blown sweetly
in our new Tabernacle; and I trust it will be said of this and that
man, at the great day, that they were born of GOD there. At _Bristol_,
in _Wales_, and _Gloucestershire_, our LORD was pleased to smile on
my feeble labours; and here in this place are several who bring forth
fruit unto GOD. Affairs go on well at _Bethesda_. Mr. _T――――_, I find,
is coming over in behalf of _New-Jersey_ College. LORD, make us all
flames of fire! The language of my soul is this, “Quicken me in thy
way.” You must continue to pray for me; you must remember me in the
kindest manner to all my dear friends, and to your father and relations
in particular, as being assured, that I am, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLXXX.


                            _To Mr. N――――._

                                         _Portsmouth, June 23, 1753._

_Dear Sir_,

NOT want of love, but leisure, prevented my answering your kind letter
much sooner. As I lead a pilgrim life, have a weak body, and am almost
continually surrounded with a variety of trials and temptations, I
cannot write so frequently as I otherwise would choose to do. However,
my friends are always upon my heart and some time next month, I hope
to see you, amongst the rest of my _Edinburgh_ acquaintances, grown
in grace, and upon the full stretch for Him who bled, and groaned, and
died for us. If your trials are not over, and you have indeed entered
upon the field of battle, I wish you joy. Fear not, neither be dismayed.
_Nil desperandum Christo duce._ Let this be the language of your heart
and mine:

              Give me strength, O GOD of power,
              Then let winds blow or thunders roar;
              Thy faithful witness will I be:
              ’Tis fix’d――I can do all through Thee.

I need not inform you, dear Sir, that our LORD hath chosen the weak
things of this world to confound the strong; and things that are not,
to bring to nought the things that are. If it was not so, what should
such a poor, weak, helpless wretch as I am do? In JESUS, and in him
alone, is all my strength and support found. Still he continues to
uphold me, and crown my feeble labours with success. In _Wales_,
_Gloucestershire_, and _Bristol_, we have lately felt his power; and in
our new Tabernacle at _London_, he hath also manifested forth his glory.
O for a good gale in the _North_! Who knows but we may see each other
some time the next month? I have thoughts of setting forwards from
_London_ next week. May the good LORD direct my goings in his way! You
must desire all of the hospitals, and in the society, and all my other
dear friends, to pray most earnestly for me. I retain my old name: I
am the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints, but for
CHRIST’s sake, dear Mr. _N――――_,

                   Their and your most affectionate
                    and willing friend and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Leicester, July 1, 1753._

_My very dear Friend_,

I CANNOT go farther (as Mr. _Middleton_ returns to _London_ to-morrow)
without sending you a few lines. They bring good news, even that the
Redeemer hath much owned and blessed the first part of my circuit.
At _Oulney_ we had two good meetings; and at _Northampton_ our LORD
filled his people as with new wine. One aged saint told me, “that the
meeting-place was no other to him than the house of GOD, and the gate
of heaven.” Several thousands attended; and I could indeed say, “It is
good for me to be here.” Last night I came to this place quite fatigued
in my body, but willing, I hope, to employ a thousand souls (if I had
them) for the dear LORD JESUS. This is a cold place, but people stood
very attentive this morning, and some were affected. To-morrow I must
move to _Nottingham_. You and yours must promise to follow me with
your prayers. I hope you will hear that they are answered. You may be
assured of mine; they are your due; they are a poor, but as they are
the only return I can make, I hope they will be accepted by, my very
dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCLXXXII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                               _Leeds, July 7, 1753._

_My dear D――――_,

WHAT! just come from the borders of the grave, and still capitulating!
Will you never give up your whole heart to Him, who hath dealt so
bountifully with you? Was this once done, you would not (especially as
you have a competency) talk of a hundred a year, but you would count
the work of the ministry its own wages, and esteem the reproach of
CHRIST above all the riches in the universe. Pray remember what _Moses_
said to _Pharaoh_, “not a hoof must be left behind.” CHRIST will have
all or none. Halt no longer between two; sin no more by withholding
from GOD what is his just due, lest a worse evil befall you. Accept all
this in love. Your letter hath extorted it from me. I pity you amidst
all your gaudy shew. The pleasure I have had but this week in preaching
the gospel, I would not part with for a thousand worlds. Blessed be GOD,
we have had sweet seasons on the road; and last night at this place,
the cups of many ran over. O LORD, keep me a pilgrim, till thou art
pleased to call me home! I can now no more. My hearty love to our dear
Mr. _H――――_. O that you was like-minded with him! Accept this as from
one, who is indeed, dear Sir,

                   Your most affectionate friend and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                         LETTER DCCCCLXXXIII.


                                               _York, July 11, 1753._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

THUS far, but no farther, am I as yet advanced in my way to _Scotland_,
and was I to comply with the pressing invitations of the _Yorkshire_
people, I know not when I should get there. The fields are exceeding
white, ready unto harvest; but by preaching thrice a day to great
multitudes, my poor tabernacle is enfeebled, and I have such a cold
that I cannot well write much. Strange, that I can do no more for Him
who hath done and suffered so much for me! Be pleased to remember me
to all; and acquaint dear Mr. and Mrs. _S――――_, that I hope to send
them an historical letter from _Newcastle_, where I expect to be next
Lord’s-day. I shall be glad to hear that your soul prospers, and that
all goes on well at the Tabernacle. I hope to see _Edinburgh_ next week.
My hearty love to all. Accept the same yourself, from, dear Mr. _D――――_,

     Your affectionate friend and servant for JESUS CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

BEING, through the goodness of a never-failing Redeemer, just come
hither, I sit down to perform my promise by writing to you. But where
shall I begin, or where shall I end? Surely the goodness of the LORD to
such a wretch as I am, is unspeakable. I will inform you of a little.
After leaving _Leicester_, I went to _Nottingham_, where a great
multitude came to hear, and I trust good was done, though a son of
_Belial_ endeavoured to disturb us. From thence I went to _Sheffield_,
where we had two good meetings. The congregation in the afternoon
consisted of several thousands. Here some dear friends from _Leeds_ met
me, two of which were my spiritual children, and all had been blessed
under the word. The next morning we set out for _Leeds_, and in our way
preached at _Rotheram_ and _Wakefield_. At the former place, I had been
disturbed twice or thrice, and was almost determined to preach there
no more. But we are poor judges. A person told me, ♦“That GOD had made
me instrumental in converting his wife and brother,” who had both been
bitter persecutors, but now gladly received me under their roof. After
preaching, a young man was set at liberty, who had been groaning under
the spirit of bondage four years; and whilst I was baptizing a child,
the Holy Spirit was pleased to baptize several, one in particular with
a holy fire. What we saw, and felt, and heard at _Leeds_, cannot well
be expressed. Thousands attended daily; and on the Lord’s-day it was
computed that near twenty thousand heard at once. I preached thrice,
and the next day at ♠_Burstall_ and _Bradford_, where many thousands
flocked also. Many were filled as with new wine; and as for myself, I
scarce knew whether I was in heaven or on earth. On _Tuesday_ morning,
though we had drank plentifully before, yet our LORD kept the good wine
till the last. We had a glorious parting-blessing. At _York_ I preached
four times. Twice we were disturbed, and twice we had sweet seasons.
There is a good work begun there. The prospect all around is so
glorious, I almost repent that I have engaged to go to _Scotland_. GOD
willing, I shall come back as fast as possible. What a pity is it that
I have but one body, and that a very weak one too. LORD, magnify thy
strength in my weakness, and send me where thou wilt. Here I am most
kindly received. How the LORD will be pleased to deal with me, you may
know hereafter. I can now only entreat the continuance of the prayers
of you and yours; and with repeated thanks for repeated favours, beg
leave to subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I WROTE to your Ladyship just before I set out for _Portsmouth_, and
thought to have written again at my return, but was hindered by staying
only one night at _London_. Ever since I have been upon the range
for lost sinners, and blessed be GOD, have been much owned by him who
delights to work by the meanest instruments. In _Northamptonshire_ our
cup ran over. In _Leicester_, the Redeemer caused us to triumph; and
in _Yorkshire_, at _Leeds_ and the adjacent places, I have sometimes
scarce known whether I have been in heaven or earth. I have been
enabled to preach thrice a day, and once at _Leeds_, perhaps to near
twenty thousand, as they were computed. Indeed we kept holy-day there.
Many came to me that were awakened at my former visits. Not unto me,
O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy free and unmerited mercy be all the
glory! In my way hither I preached four times at _York_; twice we were
disturbed, and twice all was quiet; and a sweet influence attended the
word. I lodged at Mrs. _G――――_’s, who keeps steady. She enquired most
heartily after your Ladyship, and begged to be remembered in the most
respectful manner. Hither I came on _Saturday_, and have preached seven
times, and once at _Sunderland_, where a great multitude attended, and
were deeply impressed. At five in the morning the great room is filled,
and on Lord’s-day the congregation without was great indeed. Surely the
shout of a king hath been amongst us. All is harmony and love. I am now
going to a place called _Sheep-hill_, and shall return in the evening
to preach here again. To-morrow, GOD willing, I set forwards to
_Scotland_. I could almost wish this was to be the end of my circuit,
for I want to go to various parts. LORD JESUS, magnify thy strength
in my weakness, and send me where thou wilt! If your Ladyship pleases,
this may be communicated to _C―――― W――――_, to whom I would write if
I had time. I can only now entreat the continuance of your Ladyship’s
prayers, and beg your Ladyship’s acceptance of repeated acknowledgments
for repeated favours, from, ever-honoured Madam,

                   Your Ladyship’s most dutiful and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                         LETTER [DCCCCLXXXV.]

YOURS I just now received, but know not what to say by way of answer.
The inward discouragements I have felt for above a week, against coming
to _Scotland_, have been very many. I have left a people full of fire.
Thousands and thousands flocked to hear the glorious gospel. Awakenings
I have heard of in every place; saints have been revived, and heaven
as it were come down on earth. We have enjoyed perpetual _Cambuslang_
seasons. My eyes gush out with tears of joy, (and I trust at the same
time with godly sorrow for my vileness) at the very thought of it.
My heart is quite broken, to think poor _Scotland_ is so dead. O how
gloomy hath been the aspect! I have been afraid of catching cold,
though, alas! I am too too cold towards Him, who out of warm love bled
and died for me. O that _Glasgow_ friends, if I do come, may pray for
me! I could scarce believe your letter, that your people would be glad
to see such an ill and hell-deserving, good for nothing creature as I
am. If I lose the opportunity of seeing you, I shall be disappointed
indeed. I believe I shall keep to the time proposed. O time, time, how
slowly dost thou go on! When shall I be wafted to an happy eternity?
Often within these three weeks have I hoped to die in the embraces
of my GOD. Had I a thousand souls and bodies they should be all
_itinerants_ for JESUS CHRIST. I want to see all on a flame of fire.
You know, dear Sir, what fire I mean. O! break heart strings, break,
and let the imprisoned soul be set at liberty. I want to go where
I shall neither sin myself, nor see others sin any more. My tender
love to all. I can no more for weeping. When I forget to pray for my
ungrateful vile self,――then will my worthy and dear friend cease to be
remembered by, reverend and very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                            _Glasgow, July 25, 1753._

BOTH your letters came safe to hand, and met with such a reception,
as none but those who are knit together in the love of GOD can either
experience, or have any idea of. What you mentioned concerning a
certain gentleman, melted me down.――For having met with some unexpected
pull-backs, I last night and this morning had been praying, that relief
might come from what quarter our LORD thought most proper. How true is
the saying of _Luther_:

                  Fix on his work thy stedfast eye,
                  So shall thy work be done.

This, I trust, will teach me more and more to be disinterested in what
I do for CHRIST and souls, and then never fear; even ravens shall be
sent to feed and nourish upright _Elijahs_. But above all, am I humbled
and comforted at the good news from _Leeds_, and _York_. And will the
high and lofty one then continue to delight to honour such a wretch
as I am? Then, through the divine strength, let me now begin to preach
more than ever. Yesterday I was enabled to preach five times, and I
suppose the last time to near twenty thousand, and almost to as many
in the morning. People flock and are more fond than ever to hear; at
_Edinburgh_ also, I preached twice every day to many thousands; among
whom are many of the noble and polite.――Attention sits upon the faces
of all, and friends come round me like so many bees, to importune for
one week longer stay in _Scotland_. But I think I am fixed. GOD willing,
on _Thursday_ I return to _Edinburgh_, and the _Tuesday_ following
shall set out for _Berwick_, &c. Haste, time! Fly, fly on (so that I
can but keep pace by filling thee up with duty) and bring me to see the
face of GOD in heaven. I hope to write again soon; then you will know
my rout. O that JESUS may direct my goings in his way! He will, he will.
He will never leave nor forsake those that put their trust in him; and
he knows, that as far as I know my heart, I think his work the very
best wages that can be given to,

                              Yours, &c.

_My very dear Sir_,

I WOULD have answered your kind letter before I left _Edinburgh_, but
I had not a moment’s leisure. With great difficulty I got away, after a
heart-breaking parting on _Tuesday_ about noon. On _Wednesday_ evening,
and the _Thursday_ morning, I preached at _Berwick_, and on _Thursday_
evening at _Alnwick_, in the street. It being the time of the races,
I discoursed on these words, “So run that ye may obtain.” Whilst I was
discoursing, the gentlemen came down from the race, and surrounded the
congregation, and heard very attentively. The next morning at five I
preached again, and about noon at a place called _Placy_, and in the
evening about nine at _Newcastle_, where a great number expected me.
My text was “At midnight a cry was made, behold the bridegroom cometh.”
The next morning I received the following note, “Dearly beloved in
the LORD, I write to you good news. Your labour was not in vain last
night, for my wife answered to the midnight cry, and received CHRIST
into her soul.” O that we may all praise the Three in One! Last night
I prepared for, and this morning I opened the gospel fair from these
words, “Ho! every one that thirsteth.” Much of the divine presence was
in the congregation, and I believe many tasted of CHRIST’s wine. I am
to preach three times almost every day this week. This promise supports
me. “As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.” By the inclosed, you
will see the devil owes me a grudge for what was done at _Glasgow_.
Would it not be proper to insert a paragraph to contradict it?
Thousands and thousands come to hear notwithstanding. LORD, what am I?
A poor hell-deserving creature; and yet the LORD makes use of such to
thresh the mountains with. May the LORD help me so to do, and then let
him deal with me as seemeth good in his sight. Please to remember us in
the kindest manner to dear Mr. _M――――n_, our kind host and hostess, and
all friends. I shall not forget you and yours, or your undertaking. The
LORD prosper this, and every other work of your hands upon you! My lot
is to be a pilgrim, a run-about for CHRIST. Commend me to Him who gives
strength to the weak, and for whose sake I am,

                      Yours most affectionately,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

MY rout is now fixed. After having preached here and hereabouts three
times each day, I am to leave this place on _Thursday_, to be at
_Stockton_ on _Sunday_, at _Osmotherly_ on _Monday_ noon, lie at
_Topcliff_, and reach _York_, GOD willing, by way of _Burrough-bridge_,
on _Tuesday_ next, and then come forwards to _Leeds_. I trust that our
meeting will be like that of _Jonathan_ and _David_. Only sometimes I
must change names; where it is said “_David_ exceeded,” there I will
be _David_, and you _Jonathan_. Where _Jonathan_ exceeds, there I will
be _Jonathan_ and you _David_. But more of this hereafter.――I must now
tell you good news. I could not finish this letter last night, it is
now _Tuesday_ morning. But surely heaven came down amongst us, under
the last evening preaching: it was almost too much for my body. O that
the prison door was set open, and the bird suffered to fly out of the
cage! Then would I fly to heaven, and upon one of the boughs of free
grace sing the praises of redeeming love for ever and for ever. Till
then, may we be employed in singing here on earth! But I must away to
_Horsey_ to preach, from whence I am to return to preach again in the
evening. Thrice a day tries me, but in the LORD have I righteousness
and strength. If you hear of a mob’s being raised by my preaching at
_Glasgow_, assure all your friends that there was none, but Satan owes
me a grudge for speaking against the playhouse. Particulars expect when
we meet. In the mean while, give my tender love to all, and forget not
to pray for, my dear friend.

                     Yours in our precious CHRIST,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

NOT want of respect, but leisure, hath prevented my writing to your
Ladyship. Since my last, I have been travelling and preaching twice
or thrice, and once five times a day. I cannot tell your Ladyship of
one thousandth part of what we have seen and felt. In _Scotland_ the
congregations were larger than ever. At _Glasgow_, the man who owned
the playhouse was made so uneasy by the word preached, that he took
down the roof himself. For this Satan owes me a grudge, and therefore
it is put in the paper, that a mob was raised. But there was not the
least appearance of any such thing. Our weapons are not carnal, but
mighty through GOD to the pulling down of Satan’s strong-holds. At
_Newcastle_ our LORD fills his people with new wine. Last night much
of heaven was let down into the congregation. I am now going into
the country, and am to return in the evening to preach. Thrice a day
is almost too much for this weak tabernacle, but in the LORD have I
righteousness and strength. Next week I am to be at _York_; the word
I find fastens. On _Sunday_ I hope to see Mr. _H――――_. Ere long I hope
to see our common LORD in glory. O that I may be one day lifted up from
the pulpit to the throne. Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit;
deal with me as seemeth good in thy sight! I doubt not but he deals
bountifully with your Ladyship; that you and yours may greatly increase
with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, ever-honoured
Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most obliged, dutiful and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

HITHERTO the LORD hath helped me. Blessed be his glorious name, the
fields have been every where white, ready unto harvest. I have been of
late generally enabled to preach thrice a day, and in all appearance
the word never was attended with more success. Satan rages and belies
me, about the taking down the _Glasgow_ play-houses; but I hope my
letter lately published in the _Newcastle_ journal, will set all
things right. Thanks be to GOD, without the assistance of mobs and
riots, (which my soul abhors) the christian’s weapons, through divine
assistance, are mighty to the pulling down of Satan’s strong-holds.
Alas! how many of these hath he gotten in every unregenerate person’s
heart! Blessed be his holy name for any begun conquests there; surely
his name is wonderful that hath done it. What a miracle of grace is it,
honoured Madam, that a spark of fire should be kept in, amidst an ocean
of corruption! that the bush should burn, and yet not be consumed!
Such a standing miracle I trust your Ladyship will be. To be a martyr,
a living witness for JESUS, amidst the tip-top allurements of high
life――by this we prove the strength of JESUS to be ours indeed. May the
LORD of all Lords help you, honoured Madam, to hold on and hold out. My
prayer to him for you is, “That your progress may be made known to all
men, and that you may increase with all the increase of GOD.” Glory be
to free grace, I find the happiness of the divine life an increasing
happiness indeed.――Lately our common LORD hath taken his people into
the banqueting house, and caused their cup of consolation to run over.
Surely we have been in the suburbs of heaven: ere long we shall enter
into the city itself. Our LORD is gone before to prepare the way. To
the tender and never-failing mercy of this gracious forerunner, do I
humbly and heartily recommend your Ladyship, as being, honoured Madam,

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

LAST _Saturday_ I returned to _Leeds_, from whence I had been absent
a fortnight. But what the glorious _Emmanuel_ gave us to see and
feel, is indeed inexpressible. What a sacrament at _Howarth_! We used
thirty-five bottles of wine on the occasion. I have been as far as
_Bolton_, _Manchester_, and _Stockport_. At the last place so much of
the divine presence came amongst us, that it was almost too much for
our frail natures to bear; at the former, our cup was also made to run
over. Every where the congregation looked like swarms of bees, and the
more I preached the more eager they seemed to be. At ♦_Burstall_ last
Lord’s day, perhaps there were near twenty thousand, and on _Monday_
morning at _Leeds_, the parting was the most affecting I ever saw: it
has been almost too much for me. I have not as yet half recovered it.
LORD, hasten the time when thy people shall part no more! Last night
I came hither, and preached with quietness. This morning I am setting
out for _Lincolnshire_, and have some thoughts of taking a trip to
_Ireland_. LORD JESUS, what am I that I should be called to go out into
the high-ways and hedges? Besides travelling, I have been enabled to
preach thrice a day frequently. Arrows of conviction have fled, and
of souls I hear scores have been awakened; they tell me that a hundred
have been added to _Sunderland_ society. O that the leaven may ferment
till the whole be leavened! Never did I see the work more promising.
GOD be merciful to me a sinner, and give me, for his infinite mercy’s
sake, an humble thankful and resigned heart! Surely I am viler than
the vilest, and stand amazed at his employing such a wretch as I
am; but his name is Love. I could enlarge, but must away to preach.
Ever-honoured Madam, let me intreat the continuance of your prayers,
and thereby increase the innumerable obligations already conferred
on the unworthiest of the sons of men, but, for CHRIST’s sake,
ever-honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YESTERDAY about noon, a good and never-failing Redeemer brought me and
mine in safety to town, where I expect to stay only a few days. Thanks
be to GOD for this last circuit! I think this day three months I left
_London_; since which time I have been enabled to travel about twelve
hundred miles, and to preach about one hundred and eighty sermons to
many, very many thousands of souls. More glorious seasons I never saw;
parting has almost killed me. My last excursion hath been to _York_,
_Lincolnshire_, _Rotheram_, _Sheffield_, _Nottingham_, _Northampton_,
where I believe near ten thousand souls came to hear last Lord’s day.
It was a Lord’s day indeed. Praise the LORD O my soul! I hope your
Ladyship received Governor _B――――_’s letter. I hear that your Ladyship
hath honoured me with one, but find it is gone to _Nottingham_; I
expect it to-morrow; but though somewhat fatigued, could not omit
thanking your Ladyship to-night for this and all other favours.
Innumerable are my obligations.――But the all-gracious and all-glorious
JESUS must discharge them for me. My poor prayers, is the only
pepper-corn I have got to offer by way of acknowledgment. O that I
could do something to express my gratitude! By the help of my GOD, I
will now begin to begin to love him. I am sure it is high time.――And
in doing so, and studying to promote by my feeble letters his glory and
the good of souls, I shall make the best return your Ladyship desires.
I have some thoughts of seeing _Ireland_; the LORD direct my goings in
his way! I must now wish your Ladyship a good night. My wife joins in

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

WHAT! have the birds of prey been pursuing, pecking at, and wounding
one of CHRIST’s doves? Come, my dear man, play the man, be strong in
the grace which is in CHRIST JESUS, and be not like a silly dove that
hath no heart. Look to him, and you shall be saved;

            He will give strength, he will give power,
            He will in time set free.

These enemies which so perplex us, ere long, blessed be GOD, we shall
see no more. _Pharaoh_ and his host shall be drowned in the sea.

                    Through CHRIST we shall
                    Break through them all,
                    And sing the song of Moses.

Courage then, my dear Mr. _D――――_; CHRIST’s blood shall yet purge out
all remaining gall. Alas! alas! how little do we know of our hearts?
What feathers are we, when tossed in the wind of temptations? What
greater and greater abominations shall we find, when the spirit leads
us more and more into the chambers of imagery that are within us! We
shall find, that, comparatively speaking, we know nothing as we ought
to know. O my ignorance! my ignorance! My leanness, my leanness! Pray
for me, dear Mr. _D――――_, and salute all dear friends in my name. I
will write as soon as I can. My stay in _London_ was but short, yet
I trust profitable and sweet to many. The new tabernacle was filled
with GOD’s glory under the word preached, on the letter day, and at
sacrament. I am now bound for _Staffordshire_; follow me with your
prayers, and believe me to be

                Your affectionate sympathizing friend,
                           in our dear LORD,

_My very dear Sir_,

IT is now near eleven at night, and I am to ride beyond _Coventry_
to-morrow: but I cannot close my eyes without sending you a short
account of my week’s work. On _Saturday_ last, I preached at _Oulney_,
and had a blessed season. On the Lord’s day we had two glorious
opportunities in this place, where the congregations were much larger
than before. On _Monday_ I went to _Oxen_ near _Harborough_; it was
their feast-day, but if I mistake not, some of their feasting was
spoiled. In the evening I preached at _Bosworth_; the congregation was
large as well as that at _Oxen_, and the power as great. About nine at
night I got to _Kettering_, where I preached the next morning to many
souls; the Redeemer gave us a spiritual breakfast. About five in the
evening I reached _Bedford_, and preached in the _Green_ last night,
and this morning. This afternoon we had another blessed season at
_Oulney_, and this evening I sojourn here, in order to set out for
_Birmingham_ to-morrow. A new scene of usefulness hath opened this week.
O that nothing may retard me in my pilgrim life! It is worse than death
to me, to be stopt in that. You, my dear Sir, are called to trade, I
to travel for my GOD. Whilst trading, you are in effect travelling and
preaching to thousands; for you greatly strengthen my hands in the LORD.
Great shall be your reward in heaven. O what a bountiful master do we
serve! I am loath to go to sleep, and yet this vile body stands in need
of it. My dear, very dear Sir, good night. GOD bless you and yours. I
pray for your dear yoke-fellow, and little maid, incessantly. As you
learnt long ago to look through and above unworthiness, I must still
beg you to increase my obligations, by following with your prayers.

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

“HAVING loved his own, he loved them unto the end,” says the beloved
disciple, concerning JESUS CHRIST. I would copy after this great
exemplar, and have my love like his, steady and disinterested. Thus
you have found, and I trust always will find my love to you. Works
speak better than words. I am reposing the utmost confidence in you and
yours. You are going to assist in a house, built in answer to millions
of prayers, and which I doubt not, will prove a blessing to many that
are now unborn. Look upon it in this light; think of the honour GOD
is conferring upon you; then you will launch into the deep with a
holy confidence, and when arrived at your wished for port, will behave
with humility, disinterestedness, integrity and diligence. You need
not ask any prayers, they will follow after you, though you should
even fly upon the wings of the wind. I have pawned my word for your
good behaviour in every respect, and hope to have my most sanguine
expectations answered. Get but humility, and all will be well. I am
satisfied about your passage and your room. You will remember, that
GOD is about your bed, as well as your other paths, and take care to
behave accordingly. To be a christian husband is no small matter. How
much fresh grace is now necessary for your new state of life! Your
sufficiency lives only in CHRIST. To his never-failing mercy do I
commend you, and, for his great name’s sake, subscribe myself, dear
_A――――_,

                  Your affectionate and ready friend,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

I am now at an Inn, but cannot go farther, without giving you an
account of my last week’s circuit. Since my last, I have been at
_Birmingham_, and several adjacent places. Still fresh work hath been
done, and souls fled to the gospel like doves to the windows. At a
place near _Dudley_, called _Guarnall_, I heard of a whole company
awakened by reading my poor sermons. I met with others awakened years
ago; and at one place, an old saint said, “this is the old story
fifty-five years ago.” Another near as old, said, “I was comforted when
you came last, now GOD hath sent you to me again, and I can go more
chearful to heaven.” I have heard of a great reprobate, a notorious
persecutor and drunkard, who hath been struck most powerfully. O
my dear Sir; what shall you have for helping me in outward things,
assisting me by your prayers, and thereby causing me to press forward
more chearfully in this delightful work of publishing the everlasting
gospel! I am now going to a neighbouring village, after that to
_Chester_, and from thence, purpose to return through _Staffordshire_.
GOD willing, you shall hear how it goes on, when I come to cross-plough
the ground again. In the mean while, be pleased to accept this as a
token of my love, gratitude, and respect unfeigned, and after giving my
most hearty love to dear Mrs. _S――――_ and your dear little daughter, I
subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

            Your most unworthy, though most obliged friend,
                 and ready servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXCVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                   _Wolverhampton, October 27, 1753._

_My very dear Sir_,

MY last, I think was from _Nantwich_. Since that, the ever-loving,
ever-lovely JESUS, hath vouchsafed to employ me in breaking up new
ground. I have preached four times at _Alperam_ in _Cheshire_, where
the LORD was with us of a truth, and where he had sweetly prepared my
way, by blessing several of my poor writings. At _Chester_ I preached
four times; a great concourse attended; all was hushed and quiet,
several of the clergy were present, and the word came with power. I
have since heard, that the most noted rebel in town, was brought under
deep conviction, and could not sleep night or day. Within doors, where
I preached early in the morning, conviction seemed to go through the
whole congregation. At _Liverpool_, the way was equally prepared.――A
person who had been wrought on by some of my printed sermons, met me at
landing, and took me to his house; a great number at a short notice was
convened; all was quiet here also. Some came under immediate conviction;
and I could wish to have stayed much longer, but notice was given for
my preaching at _Wrexham_, which I find since, hath been a rude place
indeed. Upon my coming, the town was alarmed, and several thousands
came to hear. Several of the baser sort made a great noise, and threw
stones, but none touched me, and I trust I can say, our LORD got
himself the victory. The next day, near _Alperam_, we had another
heaven upon earth. A divine power descended among the people, and we
could say, how awfully sweet is this place! The next morning I intended
to preach near _Nantwich_, where a Methodist meeting-house hath lately
been pulled down. Here Satan roared.――The mob pelted Mr. _D――――_
and others much, but I got off pretty free, and had opportunity of
preaching quietly a little out of town. Last night I preached here
in the dark, to a great body of hearers, for this country, and am now
bound for _Wednesbury_, _Dudley_ and _Kidderminster_. From thence,
perhaps I may come to _London_ for a few days. But this as yet is not
determined. You will either see or hear again from me soon. In the mean
while, I commend myself to the continual remembrance of your whole self,
and with ten thousand thanks for all favours, beg leave to subscribe
myself, my very dear Sir,

                    Yours, &c. in our blessed LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXCVIII.


                            _To Mr. E――――._

                                          _London, November 8, 1753._

_Dear Mr. E――――_,

MAN appoints, but it is GOD’s prerogative to disappoint, when
disappointments are necessary for our good. But how hard is it to
believe this? How apt are we in our haste to say, all these things
are against us! But what says Doctor _Watts_?

              Where reason fails with all her pow’rs,
              There faith prevails and love adores.――――

Come then, my dear Sir, and chearfully give up your _Isaac_ for GOD. He
will be better to you than a thousand creatures.

                  Leave to his sovereign sway,
                  To choose and to command;
                So shalt thou wond’ring own his way:
                  How wise! how strong his hand!

                  Far above thy thoughts,
                  His counsel shall appear,
                When fully he the work hath wrought,
                  That caus’d thy needless fear.

Ere now, I trust, the storm is blown over, and that the Redeemer hath
made you happy in himself. His love is unchangeable; this rock of ages
can never fail you. Build upon him, and you are quite safe. I could
enlarge, but time fails. Be pleased to remember us to all, and believe
me to be, dear Sir,

       Your affectionate brother and servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Gloucester, November 16, 1753._

_My dear P――――_,

I THANK you for your kind letter; it found me just returned from
another tour in the north, which, like the former, I trust hath been
owned and blessed to many precious and immortal souls. At _Liverpool_,
_Chester_, _Dudley_, _Wednesbury_, _Birmingham_, _Coventry_,
_Northampton_, and various other places, the gospel report was believed,
and the arm of the LORD was revealed. At _Nantwich_ and _Wrexham_, I
met with a little rough treatment; but what have pilgrims to expect
better, in their journeying through the wide howling wilderness of this
noisy and troublesome world? At _London_, we had blessed seasons; and
here, in my native country, the LORD of all Lords hath repeatedly made
us cry out, “how dreadful is this place!” After Lord’s day, I am bound
for _Bristol_ and _Plymouth_, and hope to get into my winter quarters
some time before _Christmas_. Glad should I be to travel for JESUS all
the year round. It is more to me than my necessary food. Thank you,
thank you my dear singing friends, for praying for me. I am persuaded,
you help to hold up my weak hands. O continue to pray, that I may
at length begin to be a pilgrim indeed. No other honour do I desire,
whilst on this side eternity. I hope to send you some new tunes ere
long. And what is better, infinitely better, I hope to join with you
in singing the song of _Moses_ and the Lamb ere long in the kingdom of
heaven. Till then, though as yet we are embodied spirits,

                We’ll strive to sing as loud as they,
                Who shine above in brighter day.

Grace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon you all. But a word or two
concerning _Jenks on the righteousness of CHRIST_. It is a precious
book, and I think your extracting Mr. _Hervey_’s recommendation, and
putting it by way of preface, to a new edition, will be sufficient.
This I know is all he would consent to have done some time ago, when
applied to by a _London_ bookseller. GOD prosper this work of your
hands upon you. Pray remember me to all my never to be forgotten
friends, and assure them, that not want of love but leisure prevents
their hearing more frequently from, my dear Sir,

       Theirs and yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                               LETTER M.


                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                     _Gloucester, November 16, 1753._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter I received, and would have answered it during my
stay in _London_ (which was only a few days) but really I was almost
killed with a multiplicity of business. The journals also I would have
sent immediately, but knew not how.――My wife promised me to embrace
the first opportunity that offered, and I hope ere long they will
come safe to hand. As for my pointing out particular passages, it is
impracticable; I have neither leisure nor inclination so to do. At
present, my doings and writings appear to me in so mean a light, that
I think they deserve no other treatment than to be buried in eternal
oblivion. “Behold, I am vile, I am vile,” is all that I can say to GOD
or man. And yet, amazing love! vile as I am, the high and lofty One
that inhabiteth eternity, still delights to honour me, by owning and
succeeding my poor feeble labours. Great things were done in and about
_Newcastle_; but far greater did we see afterwards in _Yorkshire_,
_Lancashire_, &c. Since that, I have been another tour, and have
preached at _Liverpool_, _Chester_, _Coventry_, _Birmingham_, _Dudley_,
_Wednesbury_, _Kidderminster_, _Northampton_, _Bedford_, &c. &c. Ere
now I suppose Mr. _B―――― P――――_ hath informed you, what apostolical
treatment we met with at _Nantwich_. LORD, what am I, that I should be
accounted worthy to suffer reproach for thy great name sake? At present
I am in my native country, where the LORD of all Lords hath vouchsafed
to give us several precious meetings. After a few days sojourning here,
I am bound for _Bristol_ and _Plymouth_, and in about three weeks, I
purpose to betake myself to my winter quarters. Blessed be GOD, I have
had good news from _Georgia_. O that we all may at length safely arrive
in _Abraham_’s harbour! From thence we shall never put to sea again.
My dear Sir, in the mean while, let us pray for each other. CHRIST
is in our ship, and therefore it will not sink. I commend you and
yours, and all my other never to be forgotten _Glasgow_ friends, to his
never-failing protection, and beg them, for CHRIST’s sake, to always
remember to pray for, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                     _Gloucester, November 17, 1753._

_My very dear Sir_,

IT is now just a week since I left _London_. I must not, I cannot go
any further without writing to him, who doth so much to strengthen my
hands in the LORD. And what shall I say? Truly the glorious _Emmanuel_
still continues to smile upon my feeble labours. Although I am in my
native country, yet he hath not left himself without witness. Last
Lord’s day was a high day, and since that, we have had some more
beautiful seasons in the country. I write this from a nineteen years
friend’s house, an Alderman of the city, who with his wife, are my
spiritual children. LORD, what am I? To-morrow I am to move, and expect,
besides riding, to preach thrice for some days.

              CHRIST’s presence will my pains beguile,
              And make me, though fatigu’d, to smile.

After visiting _Bristol_ and _Plymouth_, I purpose hastening to my
winter quarters. Winter quarters!――The word _winter_ almost shocks me.
Alas, winter come already, and I, ungrateful, ill and hell-deserving
I, have done so little for my GOD in the summer? How can I lift up my
guilty head? I blush and am confounded before thee, O LORD. Behold,
I am vile; O dig and dung round me, that I may bring forth more fruit
to thee my GOD! Still, my dear Sir, I must beg your prayers, and those
of your dear yoke-fellow, whom I love and honour, and whom (with your
dear little daughter) I salute much in the LORD. A sense of my own
unfruitfulness, and of GOD’s amazing condescension in employing such a
wretch, at present so over-powers me, that I am obliged to retire, to
give vent to my heart, after having subscribed myself, my very dear Sir,

      Yours under innumerable obligations, in the best of bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MII.


                            _To Mr. A――――._

                                        _Bristol, November 21, 1753._

_My very dear friend_,

I HOPED a few days ago to send you glad tidings, and blessed be
GOD, I am not disappointed. Never had I before such freedom in
_Gloucestershire_. It was so pleasant, that I intend taking it again
in my way to _London_. _Sunday_ was indeed an high day. I preached
and gave the sacrament at the new-house in the morning, and preached
again at Mr. _G――――_’s and Mr. _F――――_’s in the field, at noon and in
the evening. Showers of blessings descended from above. Mr. _L――――_
supped with me; our LORD gave us richly to feast upon his great love.
At _Painswick_ we had two pleasant seasons, and the same favour was
vouchsafed us at _Chafford_ and _Tedbury_. At _Gloucester_ also a
time of refreshing came from the presence of the LORD, and the dear
Alderman’s house was made a _Bethel_ to my soul. GOD brought me here
on _Monday_ evening, and to my great disappointment the new tabernacle
is not finished, so that I know not well what to do. However, we had
a good time last night at the hall, and I hope all this is but the
beginning of a warm winter. I am glad that the LORD JESUS deals so
bountifully with you at _London_. May he do so more and more! I believe
he will. Your motion to go to _Norwich_ I much approve of. Whatever
others design, that is nothing to us. Simplicity and godly sincerity
will carry all before it in the end. O that the sons of _Zeruiah_ could
be persuaded to let us alone! But how then should we be able to approve
ourselves sons of _David_? By thorns and briars, the old man must be
scratched to death.――O this crucifixion work! LORD JESUS help us to go
through it! He will, he will. I commend thee and thine to his almighty
protection and never-failing mercy, as being, my very dear man,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MIII.


                                        _Stroude, November 27, 1753._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

YOUR letter came to my hands at _Wrexham_, but being upon the road I
could not answer it. What said GOD to _Abraham_, “Fear not; I will be
thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.” Now is your time to approve
yourself his daughter.――My heart’s desire and prayer to the LORD of
all Lords is, that you may be strong in faith, and thereby give glory
to GOD.――I am much obliged to those who dissuade you from going.――I
find most love to be friends till they begin to have their _Isaacs_
demanded.――Let them have but a little patience: perhaps I may embark
myself.――If they do not think it a privilege to go for CHRIST over the
waters, I do.――This, even this is the language of my heart,

                    LORD, obediently I’ll go,
                    Gladly leaving all below;
                    Only Thou my leader be,
                    And I still will follow Thee.

O for a pilgrim heart! This I believe GOD hath given you, and I do not
fear repenting the confidence I have reposed in you.――That the LORD may
make you a mother in _Israel_, and bless you in taking care of his dear

     Your most assured friend and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

with us of a truth. Grace! grace!

_My very dear friend_,

THIS hath been a long fortnight, for so long it is since I wrote to
my very dear friend; but I waited to send him a bundle of good news
together. Blessed be GOD, I am not disappointed of my hope. Since my
last, I have preached several times in _Gloucestershire_, where the
people, as well as the unworthy preacher, drank plentifully of the good
wine of the kingdom. In the fields several thousands attended. Here we
have also enjoyed much of GOD; twice I preached in my brother’s great
house to the quality, amongst whom was one of _Cæsar_’s houshold. On
_Sunday_ I opened the new Tabernacle. It is large, but not half large
enough: would the place contain them, I believe near as many would
attend as in _London_. Last _Monday_ I set out for _Somersetshire_,
intending to have gone as far as _Plymouth_, but the weather was so
violent, and my call to _London_ likely to be so speedy, that I turned
back. However, I preached in _Somersetshire_ four or five times. Some
told me, they were scarce able to stand under what GOD gave them. On
_Tuesday_, at seven in the evening, I preached in the open air to a
great multitude; all was hush’d and exceeding solemn; the stars shone
exceeding bright, and then, if ever, by an eye of faith, I saw him
who calleth them all by their names. My soul was filled with an holy
ambition, and I longed to be one of those who shall shine as the
stars for ever and ever. My hands and body at this, and at other times
were pierced with cold; but what are outward things when the soul
within is warmed with the love of GOD? O my very dear Sir, increase
my obligations by continuing to pray, that this unspeakable gift may
be shed abroad abundantly in my heart by the Holy Ghost. Then shall I
not grovel as I do now here below, but mount on wings like an eagle; I
shall walk and not be weary, I shall hold on and not be faint. O that
I may die in the field! But die when or where I will, I shall die under
the strongest obligations to you and your dear yoke-fellow, who will
both know, at the day of judgment, how sincerely I subscribe myself,
very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                         _Bristol, December 3, 1753._

WHEN I saw the seal of your last sweet letter, I guessed at the
contents of it. Blessed be GOD, I was not disappointed. The heart was
soaring aloft, mounting on the wings of faith and love, and had fled
out of sight of this poor and troublesome world. Thus may that GOD, who
is rich in mercy, pay and reward all that love ill and hell-deserving
me! The devil himself dares ♦not accuse us, for serving and loving
GOD or man, for these wages. They are wages of GOD’s appointing, GOD’s
promising, GOD’s paying. May my dear friend always find such payment!
I believe he will.

              O LORD, enlarge our scanty thoughts,
              To see the wonders thou hast wrought;
              Unloose our stammering tongues to tell,
              Thy love immense, unspeakable.

I rejoice in the promising prospect of the happiness of your brother’s
houshold. May it widen and spread over all! If I have any time, I hope
to send him a few lines. LORD, hasten the time when my poor kinsmen and
brethren after the flesh shall be joined to thee by one spirit! Till
then, help me, O LORD, to be continually crying out, “Why me, LORD,
why me?” Well may distinguishing grace, and the thoughts of everlasting
love, swallow up your whole soul. Strange! that GOD’s children should
not know their own bread. But these corrupt hearts of ours still verge
towards the law. Grace, omnipotent grace alone, can enable us to see
our compleatness in CHRIST, and yet excite us, from principles of
gratitude and love, to faithfulness and zeal, as though we were to be
saved entirely by them. Glorious mystery! Like the blessed angels, may
you and yours, my dear friend, be continually employed in looking into
it! This is what I have been preaching on last week in _Somersetshire_.
The fire there warmed and enflamed me, though I preached in the air
on _Tuesday_ evening at seven o’clock, as well as on _Wednesday_ and
_Thursday_. I purposed to go as far as _Plymouth_, but providence
hath brought me back, and I am now hastening to _London_, to pay my
last respects to my dying friend. It may be, that shortly Mr. _J――――
W――――_ will be no more; the physicians think his disease is a galloping
consumption. I pity the church, I pity myself, but not him. We must
stay behind in this cold climate, whilst he takes his flight to a
radiant throne, prepared for him from the foundations of the world.
LORD, if it be thy blessed will, let not thy chariot wheels be long
in coming. Even so come LORD JESUS, come quickly! Poor Mr. _C――――_
will now have double work. But we can do all things through CHRIST
strengthening us. The residue of the Spirit is in the Redeemer’s hands,
and he hath promised not to leave his people comfortless. Our eyes, O
LORD, are unto thee from whom cometh all our salvation. Here I could
enlarge, but I must send a few lines to _London_, which I hope to
reach myself some time this week. Be pleased to direct your next there.
My _Leeds_ friends have my cordial acknowledgements for their kind
enquiries concerning me. I hope this will find them all, with your dear
yoke-fellow, leaning on the Mediator’s bosom. There am I now reclining
my weary head. Adieu. The LORD JESUS be with your spirit.

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

BEING unexpectedly brought back from _Somersetshire_, and hearing you
are gone upon such a mournful errand, I cannot help sending after you
a few sympathizing lines. The LORD help and support you! May a double
spirit of the ascending _Elijah_, descend and rest on the surviving
_Elisha_! Now is the time to prove the strength of JESUS yours. A wife,
a friend, and brother, ill together. Well! this is our comfort, all
things shall work together for good to those that love GOD. If you
think proper, be pleased to deliver the inclosed. It was written out
of the fulness of my heart. To-morrow I leave _Bristol_, and purpose
reaching _London_ by _Saturday_ morning or night. Glad should I be to
reach heaven first; but faith and patience hold out a little longer.
Yet a little while, and we shall be all together with our common LORD.
I commend you to his everlasting love, and am, my dear friend, with
much sympathy,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

IF seeing you so weak when leaving _London_, distressed me, the news
and prospect of your approaching dissolution hath quite weighed me down.
I pity myself, and the church, but not you. A radiant throne awaits you,
and ere long you will enter into your Master’s joy. Yonder he stands
with a massy crown, ready to put it on your head amidst an admiring
throng of saints and angels. But I, poor I, that have been waiting for
my dissolution these nineteen years, must be left behind to grovel here
below! Well, this is my comfort, it cannot be long ere the chariots
will be sent even for worthless me. If prayers can detain them, even
you, reverend and very dear Sir, shall not leave us yet: but if the
decree is gone forth, that you must now fall asleep in JESUS, may he
kiss your soul away, and give you to die in the embraces of triumphant
love. If in the land of the living, I hope to pay my last respects to
you next week. If not, reverend and dear Sir, farewel.――_I præ, sequar,
etsi non passibus æquis._ My heart is too big, tears trickle down too
fast, and I fear you are too weak for me to enlarge. May underneath you
be CHRIST’s everlasting arms! I commend you to his never-failing mercy,
and am, very dear Sir,

          Your most affectionate, sympathizing, and afflicted
           younger brother in the gospel of our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

THE searcher of hearts alone knows the sympathy I have felt for you and
yours, and what suspence my mind hath been in concerning the event of
your present circumstances. I pray and enquire, enquire and pray again,
always expecting to hear the worst. Ere this can reach you, I expect
the lot will be cast either for life or death. I long to hear, that I
may partake like a friend either of your joy and sorrow. Blessed be GOD
for that promise, whereby we are assured, that “all things shall work
together for good to those that love him.” This may make us at least
resigned, when called to part with our _Isaacs_. But who knows the pain
of parting, when the wife and the friend are conjoined? To have the
desire of one’s eyes cut off with a stroke, what but grace, omnipotent
grace, can enable us to bear it? But who knows, perhaps the threatened
stroke may be recalled. Surely the LORD of all lords is preparing you
for further usefulness by these complex trials. We must be purged, if
we would bring forth more fruit. Your brother I hear is better; to-day
I intended to have seen him, but Mr. _B――――_ sent me word he thought
he would be out for the air. I hope Mr. _H――――_ is better; but I can
scarce mention any body now but dear Mrs. _W――――_. Pray let me know how
it goes with you. My wife truly joins in sympathy and love. Night and
day indeed you are remembered by, my dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MIX.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                         _London, December 13, 1753._

_My dear Friend_,

THE mail not coming in till to-day, I began to fear lest something had
happened to prevent your writing. But, blessed be GOD, my fears are
dispelled, my friend is well, his temporals, his spirituals prosper:
herein I rejoice, yea and will rejoice. But what news do you tell me?
Hath an infinitely condescending GOD vouchsafed to breathe on my poor
worthless scribble? Hath life and power attended inanimate ink and
paper? This then, my GOD, shall be the language of my heart!

                Forgive my faults, and work thy will
                By such a worthless instrument;
                It will at once thy goodness shew,
                And prove thy power omnipotent.

Whatever some may boast of, I know not; but this I can say, that
although, through rich, free, and sovereign grace, I have been enabled
these nineteen years to say unto GOD, “Thou art my father,” yet I can
still say to corruption, “Thou art my sister.” Time and experience
will convince others also of this important truth. GOD keep me,
and all concerned with me, from such manifestations, as do not lead
us more and more into the chambers of imagery, which are latent and
undiscovered in the secret corners of our hearts! Such only come
from GOD: illuminations which engender pride, and lead us from a deep
and pungent feeling of our own nothingness, and the remainders of
in-dwelling corruption, are either of a diabolical extraction, or at
least are perverted by the devil and proud nature, to feed that disease,
which when operating in a genuine way, they have a native tendency
to remove. Well might Mr. _Fleming_ say, “LORD, grant me a divine
manifestation, but O teach me to manage it after thou hast granted it.”
_Paul_ needed a thorn to teach him how to manage such favours aright.
I tremble for those who hug their delusions, and look upon the dunghill
of corruption as quite removed, when it is only covered over as it were
with a little snow. How white did the most foul places look only a few
days ago! But the thaw is come, the whiteness is vanished, and filthy
dunghills are dunghills still. My dear friend knows how to make the
application. Blessed be GOD for leading you into the knowledge of the
mystery of gospel holiness.――Holiness, not built on _Moses_, or the
sandy bottom of our own faithfulness, but on JESUS, that rock of ages,
whose faithfulness makes us faithful, and a reliance on whole compleat
and all-sufficient righteousness, doings, and sufferings, carries the
believer on (without thinking of a reward) to do and suffer, what a
legal heart will shrink and boggle at. May this mind be in you and me,
and all that love our dear LORD JESUS in sincerity! When the Son of
Man makes them thus free, then will they be free indeed. You may easily
see, that part of your letter hath led me insensibly into this strain
of writing. If it pleases or profits, or both, it will answer the
end designed, and the dear, ever-dear, ever-loving, and ever-lovely
Redeemer shall have all the glory. As our acquaintance was begun in him,
and I trust hath hitherto been blessed, so I would have it continue to
run in the same channel, and, whether absent from or present with each
other, sweetly lead us to our ocean, GOD. I am only sorry you have
such an unprofitable correspondent. Tears are ready to gush out at the
thought, and I am ready to sink into the earth, when I consider how
little I can do for that JESUS, whom I love for himself, or for my
friends, whom I love for his great name’s sake. Friend of sinners,
circle me in thy own compleat and all-sufficient Self! Good night, my
dear Sir, good night. If you guess at my present frame, you will know
at whose cross this leaves me, and how much I am

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, December 15, 1753._

_My very dear Mr. V――――_,

JUST now I received, and have read over your kind letter, dated
_August_ 22d, and in reading it, could have wished for the wings of a
dove, that I might have fled and embraced you in these unworthy arms,
and wished you joy of being assured of his love, who so loved us as
to give himself for us. May this find you in the same happy frame, and
may you for ever hereafter be blessed with the uninterrupted witness
of GOD’s Spirit, witnessing with your spirit, that you are indeed his
child! As you have undergone a long and tedious law work, I hope your
joys are of the right kind, and will be more substantial and lasting,
than those who leap into a fancied liberty at once, and having no root
in themselves, in time of temptation fall away. Your house, my dear
friend, I believe, is not built upon the sand, but upon JESUS, even
JESUS of _Nazareth_, the rock of ages; against which the gates of hell
shall never be able to prevail. Whoever hath been the instrument of
bringing you into this happy frame, it is no matter to me; I rejoice,
yea and will rejoice. If I know any thing of my heart, I am just the
same disinterested person as when I saw you, and believe me, you are
my dear, very dear _Gaius_, my son, my friend still. Mr. _S――――_ can
tell you, why you received no letters. They are ready, and were sent
to his lodgings:――but to my great surprize I was told, a coach came
for him and the other passengers. Ever since I have been preaching and
travelling as usual, generally twice, and frequently thrice a day. I
came only last _Saturday_ into Winter quarters, and shall long for the
Spring again, that I may enter upon a fresh campaign. O that my dear
LORD may never discard me from this divine employ! An itinerant pilgrim
life is that which I choose.――And why? It was the life of my blessed
LORD. I hope you will not fail of calling out dear Mr. _Z――――y_ to it
every year.――I am sure _America_, dear _America_ stands much in need of
it. Let envious, lukewarm elder brethren say what they please against
it, this is the way that GOD hath honoured, yea and I believe will
honour even unto the end. But I find, love of honour, power, ease,
and fulness of bread, make even good people to think, and speak, and
act unlike themselves. These, these are the things which have led the
_Moravian_ brethren on this side the water, from the cross of CHRIST,
and made them to differ as much from what once they were, as light from
darkness. O how have my dear spiritual children, (for whom I travailed
in birth, and whom I love as my own soul) been insensibly led away, and
robbed of their spiritual and temporal substance, at least for a while,
by some self-designing and deceitful men. Against these, and not the
dear people, who have been eaten up as bread, with a bleeding heart,
have I drawn my pen; and I believe shall rejoice that I have done so to
my dying day. GOD grant that the like scene may never be opened on your
side the water! But I forbear.――O for heaven! O for that time when we
shall get out of this church militant! I long to be

              Where sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is joy and calm and peace.

Dear Mr. _J―――― W――――_ is going thither apace: he is supposed to be in
a galloping consumption. LORD JESUS, give me patience to wait till my
wished-for change also shall come! I long to awake after thy likeness;
I long to be dissolved to be with thee! Then, then shall I meet you,
my dear friend, and rejoice, together with all the blessed train that
shall follow the Lamb! O my dear Sir, bear with me, bear with me, I
pray you, for indeed I am sick of love. Surely of all the redeemed, I,
even ill and hell-deserving I, shall sing loudest in heaven. Behold I
am vile! black, but yet comely: not in myself, but in the comeliness
which my dear JESUS hath put upon me. I can now no more. I must retire
to pray for you and yours. The LORD bless you, and keep you, and give
you a heart continually to remember before his throne, my dear Mr.
_V――――_,

                Your most affectionate friend, brother,
                        and servant in CHRIST,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, December 15, 1753._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THE mail not coming in regularly, your Ladyship’s letter did not
reach me till _Thursday_ afternoon. Yesterday morning I obeyed your
Ladyship’s commands, and carried the inclosed to Mrs. _G――――_, at
St. _James_’s palace. I was much satisfied with my visit, and am much
rejoiced to find, that she seems resolved to show out at once. The
court, I believe, rings of her, and if she stands, I trust she will
make a glorious martyr for her blessed LORD. O that your Ladyship could
see your way clear to come up! Now seems to be the time for a fresh
stir. Few have either courage or conduct to head a christian party
amongst persons of high life. That honour seems to be put upon your
Ladyship:――and a glorious honour indeed it is. Till Mrs. _G――――_
can meet with company that is really in earnest, I think the closer
she keeps to her GOD and her book, the better. The LORD strengthen,
stablish, and settle her in his ways and will! I am yet kept in
suspence about Mrs. _W――――y_; and have been much concerned, lest by
intense sympathy, your Ladyship should contract an illness yourself.
But your Ladyship hath long since learnt, that as your day is, so shall
your strength be. I pray the LORD of all lords to lengthen out your
important life, and make your Ladyship ten thousand times more useful
than ever, long after my worthless head is laid in the silent grave.
If I should live to see my dear brother truly converted unto GOD, O how
would it delight me! The distant prospect is so pleasing, that I could
scarce contain myself at the news of it. I hope to hear from him soon,
having written to him lately. On _Tuesday_ I am to dine with Mr. _J――――
W――――_, who was yesterday for a few minutes at the Foundery: but I hear
his lungs are touched. I cannot wish him to survive his usefulness. It
is poor living to be nursed. But our LORD knows what is best for his
children. I wish I might have the use of _Weststreet_ chapel once or
twice a week; many want to hear at that end of the town: the Messrs.
_W――――y_’s are quite welcome to all the help I can give them. I have
no desire but to promote the common salvation among all.

                  From self and party spirit free,
                  Simply, O LORD, I’d follow thee.

Your Ladyship will still add to my innumerable obligations, by praying
that such a mind may be given to, ever-honoured Madam,

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Mrs. G――――._

                               _Tabernacle-House, December 17, 1753._

_Dear Madam_,

I WAS so well satisfied with the frame I found you in yesterday, that
I could not refrain sending you a few lines to-day. O that you may have
grace given you, to stand the first attacks that you must necessarily
meet with from every quarter! Blessed be GOD, that you are determined
to shew out at once, and to let all know, that you are determined
not so much as to attempt to compromise matters between CHRIST and
the world. One might as well attempt to reconcile light and darkness,
heaven and hell. Happy they who set out on a disinterested bottom; it
is the foundation which our great High-priest hath laid, and is a rock
that will never fail. Never fear, Madam, though storms and billows,
afflictions and temptations abide you; he that enabled the three
children to pass unhurt through the fiery furnace, and kept his beloved
_Daniel_ from being devoured in a den of lions, can and will preserve
you unspotted and undefiled, though surrounded on every side. My poor
worthless prayers shall not be wanting for you night and day. Look
up, dear Madam, determine to know nothing but JESUS CHRIST and him
crucified, and he will make your very enemies to be at peace with
you. But faith must be tried, and grace, when given, must be kept
in exercise. Welcome, welcome dear Madam, into the glorious kingdom
of the children of GOD. O that all of _Cæsar_’s houshold were in the
same situation! How would they exult in the happy change! A change
from darkness to light, from bondage and misery to the most consummate
liberty and happiness. For those whom the Son of man makes free, they
are free indeed. Now, now may you sing,

                Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,
                For I must be no longer thine;
                A nobler, a diviner guest,
                Now claims possession of my breast.

I could enlarge, but am afraid of being too bold. The freedom already
taken, proceeds from unfeigned regard to our common LORD, to good Lady
_H――――_, and to yourself, for his great name sake. I just now informed
her Ladyship of the honour done me yesterday, and of the providential
call she seems to have to town. Her Ladyship is a mother in _Israel_
indeed, a mirror of piety, detached from worldly hopes and worldly
fears, and therefore no wonder that she so simply copies after her
great Exemplar, and glories only in his blessed cross. Till you can
find some like-minded, I believe you will find your GOD and your book
the best company.――That you may be never less alone, than when you are
alone, and that you may be continually directed so to speak and act,
that you may win many souls among the rich and great to the ever-loving,
ever-lovely JESUS, is and shall be the earnest constant prayer of, dear
Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                         _London, December 17, 1753._

_Dear Mr. B――――_,

I AM sorry to find by your last, which came to hand on _Saturday_, that
the tumults in your parts still continue at such an height. I heartily
wish, that the kind and generous Justice who hath so laudably exerted
himself, may have courage to proceed in a due execution of the laws,
and I doubt not but the issue will be, that you will have peace. In the
mean while, may the Redeemer enable you and all concerned to possess
their souls in patience! I think the storm is too violent to hold
long. The death of dear Mr. _J―――― W――――_, if that should be the issue
of his present illness, I think is of a far more threatening nature.
At present, I hear he is somewhat better, but if his distemper be a
galloping consumption (as they say it is) there are but little hopes
of his surviving long. But all things are possible with GOD. O that
my tardy pace may be quickened, and my sluggish soul begin to be alive
to GOD! He hath dealt bountifully with me since we parted. In various
places the word ran and was glorified, and we had a lovely shutting-up
of the Summer’s campaign in _Gloucestershire_.――I am now in my Winter
quarters, moaning and bewailing myself, for not having done more when
the days were longer. O for Spring, that I may spring afresh for my
LORD! You and all must pray for me. I send you and yours, Mr. _C――――_
and his son, and all enquiring friends (not forgetting poor _Peggy_) my
hearty love. My wife joins with, dear Mr. _B――――_,

             Your very affectionate, sympathizing friend,
                    and servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXIV.


                         _To Mr. E―――― P――――._

                                         _London, December 17, 1753._

_Dear Sir_,

I DOUBT not but the receipt of this will fill you with surprize; yet
I hope it will be a pleasing one. Last night after preaching, your
son, who hath been lately confined, came to me and gave me a particular
detail of his seemingly unhappy circumstances.――The narration affected
me, and I asked him to stay supper; the company then with me I thought
was what he wanted.――The consequence was, that he went home rejoicing
in GOD; temptations subsided. I cannot help thinking, but that if he
conversed with proper persons who knew his case, he might yet come
forth as gold tried in the fire. His experience is somewhat uncommon,
and perhaps when sufficiently humbled, the glorious Redeemer may exalt
him. Satan hath certainly desired to have him to sift him as wheat;
but I verily believe JESUS hath prayed for him, and therefore his faith
shall not fail. As I know what unspeakable concern, tender parents must
necessarily undergo for a child in such a way, I could not help sending
a few lines to you. If the glorious _Emmanuel_, whose love constrains
me to write, should vouchsafe to bless them to the consolation of you
and yours, it would much rejoice, dear Sir,

               Your sympathizing though unknown friend,
                    and servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

I MOST sincerely rejoice in, and have given private and public thanks
for the recovery of your dear yoke-fellow. My pleasure is increased
by seeing your brother so well, as I found him on _Tuesday_ at
_Lewisham_.――O that you may both spring afresh, and your latter end
increase more and more! Talk not of having no more work in the vineyard;
I hope all our work is but just beginning. I am sure it is high time
for me to do something for Him, who hath done and suffered so much
for me.――Near forty years old, and such a dwarf! The Winter come
already, and so little done in the Summer! I am ashamed, I blush and
am confounded. And yet GOD blesseth us here. Truly his out-goings are
seen in the tabernacle. The top-stone is brought forth; we will now cry
Grace! grace! I must away. Our joint respects attend you all. I hope
Mr. _H――――_ mends; I hear that his brother is dead. LORD, make us also
ready! My most dutiful respects await our elect Lady.――GOD willing, she
shall hear soon from, my dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My Lord_,

A MATTER of some importance, is the occasion of my troubling your
Lordship with another letter. The reverend Mr. _G―――― T――――_ of
♦_Philadelphia_, and the reverend Mr. _D――――_ from _Virginia_
(both eminent ministers of JESUS CHRIST) are just arrived. They are
commissioned to apply for a general collection in _Scotland_, and
to procure private contributions for the building and maintaining a
presbyterian college in _New-Jersey_ province. What I would therefore
beg of your Lordship is, that your Lordship would do them the honour of
permitting them to wait upon you, and that they may be also introduced
to Lord _L――――_. One Mr. _D―――― D――――_, who I believe was lately
chosen a correspondent member of that society, over which your Lordship
presides, and who is a steady friend to the interests of the Redeemer,
if your Lordship is pleased to give leave, will come along with them. I
shall wait for your Lordship’s answer, and then apprize them of it. In
the mean time, I heartily wish your Lordship not the compliments, but
the blessings of the season, even all those blessings that have been
purchased for a lost world by the death and sufferings of an incarnate
GOD.――Adored, for ever adored be his free grace, he vouchsafes to
♠manifest himself amongst us here. Conviction and conversion work seems
to go on prosperously, and GOD’s people are abundantly refreshed. That
your Lordship may continually drink of divine pleasures as out of a
river, is and shall be the earnest prayer of, my Lord,

               Your Lordship’s most dutiful, obliged and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                         _London, December 27, 1753._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I AM surprized to find by your last kind letter, that my poor journals
are not come to hand. My wife informs me that they were sent to, or by
one Mr. _E――――_, who was to send off goods the very next day. Perhaps
it will please you to hear that Messrs. _T――――_ and _D――――_ supped with
me last night; may the good LORD prosper the work of their hands upon
them! I hope they will be introduced soon to the Marquiss of _L――――_,
and by him to Lord _L――――_. I shall help them all I can. At the great
day all things will be laid open. O how do I long for it! And yet, how
ashamed shall I be to appear before my LORD, when I have done so little
for him, and made such poor returns for his dying love! Would you think
it? I am this day thirty-nine years of age. Did not my business require
my attendance, I could lock myself up, and lie prostrate all the day
long in deep humiliation before him, who hath vouchsafed to call me by
his grace, reveal his son in me, and I trust made me the instrument,
(O amazing love!) of calling some others to the experimental knowledge
of the same unspeakable gift. My dear, very dear Sir, let none of my
friends cry to such a sluggish, lukewarm, unprofitable worm, “Spare
thyself.” Rather spur me on, I pray you, with an “Awake thou sleeper,
and begin to begin to do something for thy GOD.” The LORD being my
helper, I will. Do thou strengthen me, my LORD and my GOD, and I will
go for thee, at thy command, to the uttermost parts of the earth! O
break, break my heart, look to him, whom thou hast pierced.――Look and
love, look and mourn, look and praise; thy GOD is yet thy GOD! Every
day, Sir, we hear of fresh work; scores of notes are put up by persons
brought under conviction, and GOD’s people are abundantly refreshed.
Last night the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle; I cannot tell
you half.――I am lost, I am lost in wonder. I must retire to give vent
to my heart. For the present, my dear Sir, adieu! The LORD bless you
and yours, and all my other dear friends. Ere long, I hope to spend an
eternal new year with you in the _Jerusalem_ which is above. That in
the mean time, all things belonging to the old man may die in us, and
all things belonging to the new man may more and more live and grow in
us, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MXVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                           _London, January 3, 1754._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

ERE now, I hope your Ladyship is delivered from suspense, and that the
danger concerning little master is entirely over. The concern I was in
for your Ladyship when I wrote last, made me forget to speak about Mrs.
_H――――_. And indeed I cannot tell where she lodges. I could wish she
was bettered by affliction.――But alas! though, why do I speak of others,
when another new year is come, and I am bettered so little by all the
LORD hath done for and in me? O that he may dig and dung round this
barren fig-tree, that it may at length begin to bring forth some fruit
unto GOD! But who can tell what this digging and dunging means? What
temptations, afflictions and trials of every kind doth it include? And
all little enough to keep these hearts in any tolerable order. Out of
darkness he can and will bring light. That your Ladyship may experience
this more and more every day, is and shall be the earnest prayer of,
ever-honoured Madam,

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXIX.


                           _To Mr. W.――――._

                                           _London, January 5, 1754._

_My dear Mr. W――――_,

YOUR letter much affected as well as surprized me.――I may say of it as
Dr. _G――――_ says of the Apostle _Paul_’s epistle to the _Ephesians_,
“It smelt of the prison.” Surely GOD’s thoughts are not as our thoughts,
neither are his ways as our ways. How amazingly does he over-rule all
things, for the spiritual and eternal good of those who love him in
sincerity! Through his gracious and never-failing care, out of the
eater cometh forth meat, and out of the strongest trial cometh forth
unspeakable, spiritual sweetness. If this be the effect of affliction,
then may the believer boldly say,

              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain!_

Surely you may sing,

                ―――― O happy rod,
                Which brought me nearer to my GOD.

Now will you prove the strength of JESUS to be yours, now, will you
find that your very enemies shall be at peace with you; ravens shall
feed you, and the bread which you cast upon the waters many days ago,
shall now happily be found. I sympathize most sincerely with your
dear yoke-fellow, and parent. Blessed be GOD, we have a rich Saviour
to go to.――A Saviour, who though infinitely rich in himself, yet for
our sakes became poor. Rejoice then, my dear friend, for having an
opportunity of being conformed to him. And whether your affliction
be brought on you by any imprudent conduct, or by the immediate hand
of GOD, cast not off I pray you your confidence in CHRIST. He is a
compassionate high-priest. Perhaps this year, if we should live to
the fall, we may have an opportunity of conversing about him face
to face. In the mean while, let us pray for each other, and wait for
that blessed time, when we shall be afflicted and tossed no more. I
meet with my share of trials; but with thankfulness would I set up my
_Ebenezer_; for hitherto my GOD hath helped me. Glory be to his great
name, his word runs and is glorified more and more. The wilderness in
various places blossoms like a rose. May the LORD revive his work in
your parts! Mr. _D――――_ and Mr. _T――――_ have supped with me twice. I
hope they will meet with wished-for success. My wife joins in sending
love and cordial respects to your whole self, your mother, sister,
and all that love the glorious JESUS in sincerity. That you all may
increase with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, my
dear Mr. _W――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MXX.


                         _To Governor B――――._

                                          _London, January 11, 1754._

_Honoured Sir_,

I HAD the favour of your last kind letter by the hands of Messrs.
_T――――_ and _D――――_, whose work I pray the LORD of all Lords to
bless and prosper. Was Lady _H――――n_ in town, they should have been
introduced before now, but at present she is at _Bath_ drinking of the
waters of life freely, and communicating them freely to others. One
of _Cæsar_’s houshold hath been lately awakened through her Ladyship’s
instrumentality, and I hope others will meet with like blessing.
Amongst the common people the gospel also runs, and is glorified in
divers places. Our new tabernacle the Redeemer vouchsafes to fill with
his presence, and gives us daily to hear that delightful music, “The
triumphs of his word.” Winter quarters are made pleasant to me, but I
long for my Spring campaign.――Perhaps it may be a _Spring Voyage_.――For
I am now seriously thinking of a voyage to _America_, and live in hopes
of seeing your Excellency once more on this side eternity. LORD JESUS,
do thou shew me what thou wouldest have me to do! This, this I trust at
present is the unfeigned language of my heart,

                A life that all things casts behind,
                Springs forth obedient at thy call.

I beg a continued interest in your Excellency’s prayers, that I may
be kept from flagging in the latter stages of my road, and ripen
for heaven every day and every hour. I am now thirty-nine years old,
and little dreamt of being kept on earth so long; but I find we are
immortal till our work is done. O that I may now begin to begin to work
for JESUS! He is worthy, he is altogether lovely, he is the fairest
among ten thousand. To his never-failing mercy and endearing love I
most humbly recommend your Excellency’s whole self, always subscribing
myself, honoured Sir,

               Your Excellency’s most dutiful, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                          _London, January 11, 1754._

_Dear Mr. S――――_,

WHY did you not apprize me of your going? Why did you not let me have
an opportunity of sending my packets after you to _Portsmouth_? You
sailed only a day or two before I came there myself. However, I am
glad to hear that you are safe arrived. May it be an earnest of your
arriving ere long in the kingdom of heaven! Perhaps we may meet this
Summer. I hope we shall see each other grown in grace, and in the
knowledge of our LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. You and I are much
indebted to him. We have not a moment of time to lose. We ought to be
continually saying, “What shall we render unto the LORD?” O for zeal!
O for activity in his glorious service! A crucified JESUS! An incarnate
GOD! What doth his love, his dying, yet never-dying love demand at our
hands? Answer that question who can. It will nonplus men and angels.
Blessed be his free grace, we find here that his name is _Wonderful_.
Our new tabernacle is compleated, and the workmen all paid. What is
best of all, the Redeemer manifests his glory in it. Every day, souls
come crying, “What shall we do to be saved?” This I believe you will
look upon to be the best news. But I can now no more. Accept this as a
token of love unfeigned, from, my dear Mr. _S――――_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                          _London, January 19, 1754._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

ALL is well, and why? Because all things are of our LORD’s ordering.
May he perfect his strength in your weakness, and the more the outward
man decayeth, may you be strengthened so much the more by his holy
spirit in the inner man!――Welcome flux, welcome fever, welcome the
plague itself, if sanctified to bring us nearer to our GOD. Yet a
little while, and he that cometh, will come, and will not tarry. I
wish you much prosperity under the cross.――You must return the favour;
I stand in need of much prayer. Perhaps ere long I may be called to
occupy my business in the great waters. If not, GOD willing, you shall
see me. In the mean while, pray give my love to all, especially to
those mentioned in your last. GOD help them to hold on and hold out!
In heaven they will sing the louder for being called by such an ill and
hell-deserving creature as I am. Blessed be GOD, awakening work goes
on here: every sermon preached this Winter hath been fetched out of the
furnace.――But what are we to expect as christians and ministers, but
afflictions? I thank you for your kind offer, and orders to command.
Such I seldom comply with. Though poor, yet desiring at least to make
many rich, I would have for my motto still. Some way or another, my GOD
will supply all my wants. I am sorry that the volume of the _Christian
Library_ was forgotten. I shall write to my dear Mr. _S――――_ to send
you his, and yours may be sent to him. Whatever becomes of written
christian libraries, I earnestly pray that your heart, my dear Sir,
may be the library of JESUS CHRIST, and beg leave to subscribe myself,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, January 19, 1754._

_Dear Mr. W――――_,

AS my embarking for _America_ seems to be very near at hand, your
question must necessarily be answered in the negative. However, I
thank you for your kind offer, and earnestly pray that wherever you are
called to labour, you may find the work of the LORD prospering in your
hands. I did not know that there was any demur between you and those
with whom you have been for some time connected; and I am sure, GOD is
my witness, that I want to draw no man from them. People, money, power,
are not my objects. I desire to know nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him
crucified, and to be a willing pilgrim for his great name’s sake. At
present this is the language of my heart,

                      LORD, obediently I’d go,
                      Gladly leaving all below.

I intreat you to pray that my faith fail not. LORD, increase it for
thy infinite mercy’s sake! We have blessed seasons here: the glory of
the LORD fills our new tabernacle. If possible, I shall send the books
you desire to _Leeds_. I hope you find your present illness sanctified.
That is a sign of special love.――Adieu. I am in great haste. But with
greater love, I subscribe myself, dear Mr. _W――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, February 2, 1754._

_Dear Sir_,

BY your writing, I guess you are a brand plucked out of the fire of
the polite and gay world.――Happy deliverance! I intreat you to rejoice,
give thanks, and sing,

                Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,
                For I must be no longer thine;
                A fairer, a diviner guest,
                Now claims possession of my breast.

I do not wonder to hear of your being under trials; you are to be made
perfect by them. Right-hand and right-eye corruptions are not so easily
cut off, or plucked out; but this must be done. Not one _Agag_, however
beautiful, and importunate for life, must be spared: the sword of the
spirit must be lifted up, and as an enemy to the LORD of life and glory,
he must be hewn to pieces. JESUS, the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS,
cannot away with idols:――And why? Because they rob us of our peace,
estrange us from our GOD, and unfit us for the enjoyment of that better
world, where I hope to see you encircled in the arms of redeeming love.
Flee therefore, dear Sir, flee, I intreat you, youthful lusts. JESUS
will give you wings and feet, and after all reward you, as though you
fled in a strength of your own. O often, often contemplate, and dwell
upon his dying for you. This will sweetly constrain you to be willing
even to die for him, and powerfully constrain you to be ready to every
good word and work. O that I may take this advice myself! You must pray
that I may; a trial is at hand. In about three weeks I am bound for
_America_.――A multiplicity of business lies before me; but to convince
you that your correspondence is not troublesome, I snatch a few minutes
to send you these lines, from, dear Sir,

        Your affectionate friend and servant for CHRIST’s sake.

                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind letter came safe to hand.――I immediately sent
for Mr. _M――――_, delivered his, and saw it consumed. He hath the most
grateful sense of your Ladyship’s great benevolence. It is, as your
Ladyship suspects in relation to his wife; she is a _Zipporah_, a thorn
in the flesh. Ministers must expect such things. I hope your Ladyship
is enabled to bear with fortitude the scratches you must necessarily
meet with in this wide howling wilderness. You have a Beloved to lean
upon, who is mighty and willing to save. Blessed be his name, for
giving you a heart to retire from the pomps and vanities of a dreaming
and delusive world. Happy they, who can enjoy their GOD and themselves.
This only the true christian can do. Such a one I believe your Ladyship
to be.――My prayer to the LORD of all Lords in your Ladyship’s behalf,
is that you may grow in grace, and abound continually in every good
word and work. This is the only return I can make your Ladyship for the
regard and concern you have expressed for me, as an unworthy minister
of the Son of GOD. For his great name sake, I expect in a fortnight,
once more to launch into the great deep, with about ten or twelve poor
destitute orphans under my care. O my GOD, why am I thus honoured, to
be employed as a pilgrim for thee? I trust this is the language of my
heart,

                A life that all things casts behind,
                Springs forth obedient to thy call;
                A heart that no desire can move,
                But still t’adore, believe and love,
                Give me, my LORD, my life, my all.

But whither am I going? Be pleased, honoured Madam, to excuse this
freedom; your Ladyship’s kind letter constrains me to write thus.
Honoured Madam, I thank you a thousand and a thousand times, for all
your kind offers of serving me, and the church of GOD. At present
(since you have so lately let the tabernacle have such an instance
of your regard) I have only to beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s
prayers, and to subscribe myself without dissimulation, honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
              ready servant for the dear Redeemer’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXVI.


                           _To Mrs. G――――._

                                         _London, February 15, 1754._

_Dear Madam_,

WITH this I send you the promised pamphlet, which was written with
a single eye to prevent fraud and superstition, and to promote the
Mediator’s glory. Notwithstanding, I would advise you, dear Madam, not
to let other people’s foibles drive you from the cross of CHRIST: he is
altogether lovely.――And if persons were more taken up in contemplation
of his loveliness, and their own deformities, they would not have so
much time to talk of others, nor take so much pains to gain proselytes
to any particular party under heaven. Such a practice is beneath the
dignity of a free-born child of GOD.――His spirit breathes another
kind of language, and teaches us to be all eye within. O that your
heart may be filled with that wisdom which is from above, which is
first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, without
partiality, without hypocrisy, and full of faith, self-denial, zeal,
disinterestedness, and good works! That JESUS, whom I believe you love,
is able, dear Madam, to fill you with this wisdom. He hath promised,
“if we ask, it shall be given.” Nay, he hath said, “that he giveth
liberally and upbraideth not.” May you be enabled to lay hold on him
in the omnipotence of prayer, and find grace to help in every time of
need! Have you not found him faithful, in your intended visit to your
friend? May you be made wise as an angel of GOD, to win her and others
over to the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS! Pray, dear Madam, have you
heard from _Bath_? There is a copy you may safely write after; but a
perfect one is no where to be found but in our common LORD, the God-man
CHRIST JESUS. To his tender and never-failing mercy do I most humbly
recommend you, and, for his great name’s sake, most heartily subscribe
myself, dear Madam,

                 Your most obliged and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MXXVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――_

                                    _Lisbon Harbour, March 17, 1754._

_My very dear Sir_,

SURELY our GOD is a prayer-hearing, promise-keeping GOD. He delights
to disappoint our fears, and even exceeds our hopes. On the seventh
instant we left _Gravesend_; on the eighth we passed through the downs,
and yesterday we anchored in this port. Through the channel we met not
with the least obstruction, neither had we the least contrary wind all
the way. _Cape Finisterre_, the _Burlings_, and the rock of _Lisbon_,
(high-lands we desired to make) we came directly upon, and though the
wind was very high, yet being for us, it was not so troublesome, but
(like sanctified afflictions to the christian) drove us nearer to our
desired haven. We are now lying before a large place, where we see
hundreds going to worship in their way. We have just been at ours, and
I trust I have felt something of that rest, which remains, even on this
side eternity, for the people of GOD. You and yours are not forgotten
by me at his throne. No, I remember you night and day, and am longing
for that happy time, when we shall part no more. Though sent without a
friend to return with me, yet I am not left alone. I thank the LORD of
all Lords, for honouring me so far as to employ me on such expeditions
as these. O my GOD, what am I, that I should be called to leave my
native country, and to sacrifice not only my carnal but spiritual
affections for thee! Thy presence on earth, thy presence in heaven,
will make amends for all. Well! Blessed be GOD, this heaven is at hand.
Yet a little while, and he that cometh, will come, and will not tarry.
O that he may find us busy for him! I am persuaded this will be your
case. Add, my dear Sir, to my manifold obligations, by praying that
it may be mine also.――Fain would I be kept from flagging in the latter
stages of my road; fain would I return to my native country (if I
am to return) grown in grace, and in the knowledge of our LORD and
Saviour JESUS CHRIST. Indeed he is a good master. He hath given me the
affections of all on board, and as kind a Captain as we could desire.
What I meet with when on shore, you may know hereafter. I grudge your
paying postage for my poor scribble, and yet I know not well how to
prevent it. Be pleased to put it down to the amount of our common LORD,
and if you have any leisure from working for the poor, and trading for
him, let me have a line. I recommend you and them to the Redeemer’s
never-failing mercy, and am, I trust with some degree of gratitude,
very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MXXVIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                    _Lisbon Harbour, March 19, 1754._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

HOW soon does the scene shift? At what a distance, in a few days, may
we be removed from each other! On the sixteenth instant, that GOD whom
I desire to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, brought me and my
orphan charge to this harbour. As yet I have not been on shore, but
expect to go to-morrow. At this distance, I see enough to bless the
LORD of all Lords for calling me out of darkness into his marvelous
light, and for redeeming me from this present evil world. O my dear
friend, to an eye fixed on the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS, how
little, unspeakably little do all sublunary things appear. I hope this
will find my dear Mr. _B――――_ crying out from the bottom of his heart,
“indeed they are not worth a thought.” Well said, my dear Sir; let us
then be laudably ambitious, and get as rich as we can towards GOD; such
are durable riches. The bank of heaven is a sure bank. I have drawn
thousands of bills upon it, and never had one sent back protested.
GOD helping me, I purpose lodging my little earthly all there. I
hope my present poor but valuable cargo, will make some additions
to my heavenly inheritance. O free grace! That ever such an ill and
hell-deserving wretch as I am, should ever be called out to leave his
carnal and spiritual friends, for that friend of sinners the Lamb of
GOD! These partings are indeed trying to nature; but heaven, my dear
Sir, will make amends for all. There I hope to meet you and yours, whom
I love in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST; there you shall be amply rewarded
for all acts of kindness conferred either on me or mine. Increase my
obligations, by continuing to pray for us, and accept this as a small
tribute of thanks, and a testimony of love unfeigned, from, my dear
friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXIX.


                          _To Mr. R. K――――n._

                                            _Lisbon, March 21, 1754._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

I DO not forget my promise, either in respect to writing or praying.
――Though at this distance, I am still present in spirit with you and
yours, and with my other dear _London_ friends; and I live in the
expectation of seeing them all grown in grace, and in the knowledge of
our LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.――This leaves me an old inhabitant
of _Lisbon_.――We have now been here almost a week, and I suppose shall
stay a fortnight longer.――A very reputable merchant hath received me
into his house, and every day shews me the ecclesiastical curiosities
of the country.――O my dear friend, bless the LORD of all Lords for
causing your lot to be cast into such a fair ground as _England_, and
giving you such a goodly heritage.――It is impossible to be sufficiently
thankful for civil and religious liberty, for simplicity of worship,
and powerful preaching of the word of GOD.――O for simplicity of manners,
and a correspondent behaviour! “What shall I render unto the LORD
for these amazing mercies,” ought surely to be the language of our
hearts.――O that I was thankful! O that I was humble! My obligations
to be so increase daily.――Every where does the LORD of all Lords
command somebody or another to receive me.――All is well on board,
and _Lisbon_ air agrees with my poor constitution extremely.――Through
divine assistance, I hope what I see will also much improve my better
part, and help to qualify me better for preaching the everlasting
gospel.――Amazing, that such an honour should be conferred on such an
ill and hell-deserving worm! O pray for me, my dear friends, and add
to my obligations by frequently visiting my poor wife.――Kindnesses
shewn to her in my absence, will be double kindnesses.――You must
remember me to dear Mr. _C――――n_, to your relations, and all enquiring
friends.――Adieu! The LORD JESUS be with your spirits. I am, my dear
Mr. and Mrs. _K――――n_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXX.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                            _Lisbon, March 26, 1754._

_My dear Friend_,

SHALL I promise and not perform? I dare not. This therefore comes to
inform you, that I am now as it were an old inhabitant of _Lisbon_,
having been here above a week. In that time, what have I seen and
heard? Strange and incredible things, not more strange than instructive.
Never did civil and religious liberty appear to me in so amiable
a light as now. What a spirit must _Martin Luther_, and the first
Reformers be endued with, that dared to appear as they did for GOD!
LORD, hasten that blessed time, when others, excited by the same spirit,
shall perform like wonders. O happy _England_! O happy Methodists,
who are Methodists indeed! And all I account such, who being dead to
sects and parties, aim at nothing else but an holy method of living to,
and dying in the blessed JESUS. This be their, this be my happy lot!
Blessed be his name for calling me to a pilgrim life! Thanks be to
his great name, for constraining me to leave all that is near and dear
to me, for the sake of his glorious gospel. He takes care to provide
for me. A gentleman hath most gladly received me into his house, and
behaves like a friend indeed. To-day I dine with the Consul: ere long,
I hope to sit down and eat bread in the kingdom of GOD. I wait for this
salvation, O LORD! You must pray for me, and desire others to join with
you. I intend writing to our elect Lady before I leave _Lisbon_. In
about ten days we expect to sail. For the present, adieu! This leaves
us all well. My fatherless charge is in good health. O that they may be
converted and made new creatures in CHRIST! O that I may begin to begin
to be converted myself.――I am a dwarf.――Less than the least of all,
shall be my motto still. As such, pray for, my dear friend.

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXXXI.


                            _To Mr. A――――._

                                            _Lisbon, March 29, 1754._

_Very dear Friend_,

INDEED you have lost the seeing and hearing of many strange, but to a
truly enlightened soul, instructive things. I thank GOD for sending me
here; I know your heart hath been here also; but all is well.――What is,
is best. I hope you go on comfortably at home, whilst I, unworthy, ill
and hell-deserving I, am travelling for the same LORD JESUS abroad. He
doth not leave me comfortless,――he doth not leave me alone;

                His presence doth my pains beguile,
                And makes me tho’ alone to smile.

O the happiness of seeing and enjoying all in GOD, even a GOD in
CHRIST! Such happiness they only can know, who being separated from all
that is near and dear unto them, can wrap themselves in Him, in whose
presence there is life, and at whose right hand there are pleasures
for evermore. This be my happy lot, during my present exile state!
O my dear tabernacle friends, my dear never to be forgotten hearers,
into what a fair ground is your lot cast! What a goodly heritage hath
the LORD of all Lords vouchsafed you! I remember my promise, I think of
your hours of meeting, and though absent in body, am, notwithstanding,
present in spirit, and live in hopes of hearing of your stedfastness
and joy in GOD our Saviour. Bless him, O bless him from your inmost
souls, that you have been taught the way to him, without the help of
fictitious saints. Thank him night and day, that to you, even to you
are committed the lively oracles of GOD. Adore him continually for
giving you to hear them preached with power, and pity and pray for
those, who are forbid the use of this sacred depositum, and are led
blindfold day by day, by crafty and designing men. May you see and
improve your privileges! Much, very much indeed is given you. Of you,
therefore, GOD and man may justly require the more: accept this in love.
Continue to pray for me and my fatherless pilgrim charge. Blessed be
GOD they are all well. I write this from a merchant’s house, whom the
LORD of all lords hath inclined to receive me; let him not be forgotten.
In a short time we expect to move. Still my request is, “If thy
presence go not with me. LORD JESUS, send me not even from hence!” I
wish you all, dear friends, much, very much of it. I intend to write to
as many as I can, and I beg them and you to accept this as a token of
love unfeigned, from, my very dear _T――――_,

       Theirs and yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear and honoured Sir_,

THROUGH the goodness of a gracious and never-failing GOD, we have been
at this place near a fortnight. Our voyage was but about nine days
long, and the same GOD who took care of us on the great deep, hath also
provided for me on shore. A merchant of great credit hath received me
into his house, and every day I have seen or heard something, that hath
had a native tendency to make me thankful for the glorious reformation.
O that our people were equally reformed in their lives, as they are
in their doctrines and manner of worship! But alas! alas!――O for
another _Luther_, O for that wished-for season, when every thing
that is antichristian shall be totally destroyed by the breath of
the Redeemer’s mouth, and brightness of his appearing! Then should I,
even ill and hell-deserving I, be entirely conformed to the copy of
my great Exemplar, and nor be such a dwarf as I am in the divine life.
As my present situation leads me to be all eye and ear, I endeavour
to look more into my heart. But the more I see it, the more I admire
the freeness and richness of that grace, that hath called me out of
darkness into GOD’s marvelous light, and made me a minister of the
everlasting gospel. May this voyage be over-ruled for my improvement
in that delightful employ! Hitherto, I think it hath done me good. The
country agrees with my bodily health; and, through grace, I trust what
I have seen and heard hath benefited my soul. My fatherless charge are
all well, and I hope in a few days we shall set sail for _Georgia_.
From thence, GOD willing, honoured Sir, you shall hear from me again.
In the meanwhile, I recommend myself to the continuance of your daily
intercession, as being, very dear and honoured Sir,

            Your most dutiful, obliged, though unworthy son
                   and servant in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MXXXIII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                            _Lisbon, March 30, 1754._

_Very dear Sir_,

THIS leaves me pretty well satisfied (not to say surfeited) with the
ecclesiastical curiosities of _Lisbon_. This day fortnight we arrived;
and the country being in want of rain, and it being _Lent_ season, we
have been savoured with frequent processions, and several extraordinary
pieces of scenery. Alas! to what lengths will superstition run! And
how expensive is the pageantry of a false religion! Blessed be GOD
for being born in _England_! Blessed be GOD for being born again, and
thereby being taught to worship the Father in spirit and in truth!
This, my dear Sir, I believe is your happy portion; and therefore if it
should be our lot never to meet here any more, I am persuaded nothing
can prevent our meeting in a blissful country hereafter. O that we may
be kept from flagging in the latter stages of our road! I am confounded,
when I think what a drone I have been, and daily wonder why the LORD
employs such a worthless wretch.――Surely it must be, that in me he
may shew all long-suffering. Help me, my dear friend, to praise him.
_Lisbon_ air seems healthy for the body; and what I have seen and heard
I trust will benefit my soul. Be pleased to remember me to Mrs. _C――――_,
your son, and all enquiring friends. You will not forget to visit my
widow wife. Blessed be GOD, her Maker is her husband, and ere long we
shall all sit down together at the feast, the marriage supper of the
Lamb. In a believing prospect of this, I subscribe myself, very dear
Sir,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MXXXIV.


                            _To Mr. F――――._

                                            _Lisbon, March 31, 1754._

_Dear Sir_,

I OWE you much love.――I wish you and yours much ♦happiness, and
earnestly pray that you may walk together many years as heirs of the
grace of life. Was I to be confined long in my present situation, I
should be in danger of envying my protestant friends, who breathe in
a free air, and are taught to worship the father of spirits in spirit
and in truth. This I fear is the lot but of few here; all is pageantry
and pomp. Particulars perhaps I may send by another opportunity.
Blessed be GOD that I have seen and heard for myself. It surpasseth all
description. This week we expect to sail: I beg the continuance of both
your prayers; it will be a very great act of charity; for indeed I am
a poor helpless worm, but notwithstanding, if I know any thing of my
heart, willing to spend and be spent for JESUS. He doth not forsake me
on the mighty waters.――My fatherless charge are all well, and in due
time I hope we shall safely arrive at our desired port.――Ere long I
hope to be, from whence I shall never put to sea any more. O for a
triumphant entrance into the blissful harbour! JESUS is able to do this

brother, and all enquiring friends, as being, dear Sir,

_My dear Friend_,

BY this time, I suppose, you have heard of my arrival at _Lisbon_, and
are wondering what led me thither, especially since my last informed
you of my intention to go to _Georgia_ by way of _New-York_. This was
really my design at the time of my writing; but being afterward called
by Providence to take with me several orphan children, I thought it
most adviseable to go and settle them, and my other domestic affairs,
at the Orphan-house first, that I might visit the northern parts of
_America_ with more ease and freedom in my own mind.――It happened
that the _Success_, Captain _Thomson_, bound for _Port-Royal,
South-Carolina_, (which is not very far from _Georgia_) was then almost
ready to sail.――I sent for the Owner, and finding that the ship was to
touch at _Lisbon_ to unload some wheat, it occasioned a little demur;
but, upon second thoughts, believing it might be serviceable to me, as
a preacher and protestant, to see something of the superstitions of the
church of _Rome_, I took my passage, and embarked in the _Success_ the
7th of _March_. On the 14th we reached _Cape Finister_. On the 15th
came in sight of the _Burlings_; and on the 16th anchored safe before
_Bellem_, about four miles distance from _Lisbon_, the metropolis of
_Portugal_. As I knew nobody there, and had formed but an indifferent
idea of the inhabitants, from the account that had been given me of
them, I had purposed within myself to keep on board, and go ashore
only now and then in the day-time. But Providence so ordered it, that
a gentleman of the factory, who had heard me himself, and whose brother
had been awakened under my ministry several years ago, immediately, on
hearing of my arrival, sent me an offer of his house during my stay. I
thankfully accepted it; and special leave being procured for my going
ashore, I was carried in a chaise and pair from _Bellem_ to _Lisbon_.
A new scene, both in respect to the situation of the place, the fashion
of the buildings, and the dress of the inhabitants, presented itself
all the way. But what engaged my attention most, was the number of
crucifixes, and little images of the _Virgin Mary_, and of other real
or reputed saints, which were placed almost in every street, or fixed
against the walls of the houses almost at every turning, with lamps
hanging before them. To these, I observed the people bow as they passed
along; and near some of them stood several little companies, singing
with great earnestness.――――This seemed to me very odd, and gave me an
idea of what further ecclesiastical curiosities would probably fall in
my way, if I should be detained here any time. These expectations were
quickly raised; for, not long after my arrival at my new lodgings,
(where I was received and entertained with great gentility, hospitality
and friendliness) upon looking out of the window, I saw a company of
priests and friars bearing lighted wax tapers, and attended by various
sorts of people, some of which had bags and baskets of victuals in
their hands, and others carried provisions upon their shoulders on
sticks between two. After these, followed a mixed multitude, singing
with a very audible voice, and addressing the _Virgin Mary_ in their
usual strain, “_Ora pro nobis._” In this manner they proceeded to
the prison, where all was deposited for the use of the poor persons
confined therein. But a far more pompous procession of the like nature
(as a stander-by informed me) passed by a few days before. In this
there were near three hundred _Franciscan_ friars, many of which
(besides porters hired for the purpose) were loaded with a variety of
food; and those who bore no burden, carried either ladles or spoons in
their hands. Sights of this nature being quite a novelty to me, I was
fond of attending as many of them as I could. Two things concurred to
make them more frequent at this juncture,――the season of _Lent_,――and
an excessive drought, which threatened the total destruction of the
fruits of the earth. For the averting so great a judgment, and for the
imploring the much longed-for blessing of rain, daily processions had
been made from one convent or another, for a considerable time.――One of
these I saw: it was looked upon as a pretty grand one, being made up of
the _Carmelite_ friars, the parish priests, and a great number of what
they call the brothers of the order, who walked two by two in divers
habits, holding a long and very large lighted wax-taper in their right
hands. Amidst these was carried, upon eight or ten mens shoulders, a
tall image of the _Virgin Mary_, in a kind of man’s attire; for I think
she had a very fine white wig on her head, (a dress she often appears
in) and was much adorned with jewels and glittering stones. At some
distance from the Lady, under a large canopy of state, and supported
likewise by six or eight persons, came a priest, holding in his hand
some noted relic. After him, followed several thousands of people,
joining with the friars in singing, “_Eandem cantilenam, Ora pro
nobis_,” all the way. Still rain was denied, and still processions were
continued. At length the clouds began to gather, and the mercury in the
barometer fell very much. Then was brought out a wooden image, which
they say never failed. It was the figure of our blessed LORD, cloathed
with purple robes, and crowned with thorns. I think they call him the
LORD OF THE PASSION. Upon his shoulders he bore a large cross, under
the weight of which he was represented as stooping, till his body
bent almost double. He was brought from the _Le Grass_ convent in very
great pomp, and placed in a large cathedral church.――――Being on board
at that time, I lost this sight; but the subsequent evening I beheld
the SEIGNEUR fixed on an eminence in a large cathedral church, near
the altar, surrounded with wax tapers of a prodigious size.――He was
attended by many noblemen, and thousands of spectators of all ranks
and stations, who crouded from every quarter, and in their turns, were
admitted by the guards to come within the rails, and perform their
devotions. This they expressed by kneeling, and kissing the SEIGNEUR’s
heel, by putting their left and right eye to it, and then touching
it with their beads, which a gentleman in waiting received from
them, and then returned again. This scene was repeated for three days
successively; and during all this time, the church and space before
it was so thronged with carriages and people, that there was scarce
any passing. The music on this occasion was extremely soft, and the
church was illuminated in a very striking manner. The third day in the
forenoon it rained, and soon after the SEIGNEUR was conducted home in
as great splendour, and with much greater rejoicing, than when he was
brought forth. As my situation was very commodious, I saw the whole;
and afterwards went and heard part of the sermon, which was delivered
before him, in the church to which the SEIGNEUR belonged. The preacher
was full of action; and in some part of his discourse, (as one who
understood _Portuguese_ informed me) pointing to the image, he said,
“Now he is at rest.――He went out in justice, but is returned in mercy.”
And towards the conclusion, he called upon the people to join with him
in an extempore prayer. This they did with great fervency, which was
expressed not only by repeating it aloud, but by beating their breasts,
and clapping their cheeks, and weeping heartily.――――To compleat the
solemnity, immediately after the delivery of the blessing, all on a
sudden, from the place near which the image stood, there was heard
a most soft and soothing symphony of music, which being ended, the
assembly broke up, and I returned to my lodgings; not a little affected,
to see so many thousands led away from the simplicity of the gospel,
by such a mixture of human artifice and blind superstition, of which
indeed I could have formed no idea, had I not been an eye witness. This
concern was still increased, by what I heard from some of my fellow
passengers, who informed me, that about eleven one night, after I came
aboard, they not only heard a friar preaching most fervently before
the SEIGNEUR, but also saw several companies of penitents brought in,
lashing and whipping themselves severely. How little unlike this, to
those who cut themselves with knives and lancets, and cried out from
morning till night, “O Baal, hear us.”――――Methinks I hear you say, “And
had I been present, I should have wished for the spirit of an _Elijah_
to――” Hush, my friend,――I am content to guess at the rest till we meet.
In the mean while, let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that
there is a season approaching, when the LORD GOD of _Elijah_ will
himself come, and destroy this and every other species of antichrist,
by the breath of his mouth, and the brightness of his appearing, even
by the all-conquering manifestations of his eternal Spirit. Whether as
men, christians, and protestants, we have not more and more reason to
pray night and day, for the hastening on of that glorious and long
wished-for period, you will be better able to judge, when I send you
(as I purpose to do, if I have time) a further account of a _Lent_
procession or two, of which I was also a spectator.――――At present I
can only beg a continual remembrance at a throne of grace, as being,
my dear friend,

              Yours most respectfully in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Lisbon, April 3, 1754._

_My dear Friend_,

THOUGH some other business demands my attentions yet I must not forget
the promise made you of a further account of the processions I saw at
_Lisbon_.――――Some of those already mentioned, were extraordinary, by
reason of their great drought; but that which is to be the subject of
my present letter, was an annual one: it being customary at _Lisbon_
to exhibit some procession or another every _Friday_ in _Lent_. An
intelligent Protestant, who stood near me, was so good as to be my
interpreter of the dumb shew as it passed along.――I say _dumb shew_:
for you must know it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden images,
carried on mens shoulders through the streets, intending to represent
the life and death of St. _Francis_, the founder of one of their
religious orders. They were brought out from the _Franciscan_ convent,
and were preceded by three persons in scarlet habits, with baskets in
their hands, in which they received the alms of the spectators, for
the benefit of the poor prisoners. After these, came two little boys
in party-coloured cloaths, with wings fixed on their shoulders, in
imitation of little angels.――Then appeared the figure of St. _Francis_,
very gay and beau-like, as he used to be before his conversion. In the
next, he was introduced under conviction, and consequently stript of
his finery. Soon after this, was exhibited an image of our blessed LORD
himself, in a purple gown, with long black hair, with St. _Francis_
lying before him, to receive his immediate orders. Then came the Virgin
Mother, (_horresco referens_) with CHRIST her son at her left hand,
and St. _Francis_ making his obeisance to both.――――Here, if I remember
aright, he made his first appearance in his friar’s habit, with his
hair cut short, but not as yet shaved in the crown of his head. After
a little space, followed a mitred Cardinal gaudily attired, and before
him lay St. _Francis_ almost prostrate, in order to be confirmed in his
office. Soon after this, he appears quite metamorphosed into a monk,
his crown shorn, his habit black, and his loins girt with a knotted
cord.――Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a cross, that the marks
of the wounds in his hands, feet, and side, might be impressed on the
same parts of his body. The prayer is granted; blood comes from the
hands, feet, and side; and the saint, with great devotion, receives the
impressions. This was represented by red waxen strings, reaching from
those parts of the image to the corresponding parts of St. _Francis_’s
body. Upon this he begins to do wonders; and therefore, in a little
while, he is carried along, as holding up a house which was just
falling. This miracle, they say, was performed (if my information be
true) at _Madrid_, but the particulars of its history I have forgotten.
At length the father dies, and is brought forth lying in his grave.
But lo! the briars and nettles under which he lay, are turned into fine
and fragrant flowers. After this he is borne along upon a bier covered
with a silver pall, and four friars lamenting over him.――――He then
appears for the last time, but with an increase of power; for he was
represented as drawing tormented people out of purgatory with his
knotted cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor souls catched at,
and took hold of very eagerly. At length came a gorgeous friar under a
splendid canopy, bearing in his hand a piece of the holy cross. After
him followed two more little winged boys, and then a long train of fat
and well-flavoured _Franciscans_, with their _Calceis Fenestratis_,
as _Erasmus_ calls them; and so the procession ended. Methinks I hear
you say, “It is full time;”――and so say I: for as the sight itself
disgusted me, so I am persuaded the bare narration of it, though ever
so short, cannot be very pleasant to one who I know abhors every thing
that savours of superstition and idolatry. We will therefore take our
leave of St. _Francis_, whose procession was in the day time: but I
must tell you it is only to inform you of another of a much more awful
and shocking nature, which I saw afterwards at night. About ten o’clock,
being deeply engaged in conversation with my kind host, in came an
_Englishman_, and told me in all haste, that he had seen a train of
near two hundred penitents passing along, and that in all probability
I might be gratified with the same sight, if I hastened to a place
whither he would conduct me. I very readily obeyed the summons, and,
as curiosity quickened my pace, we soon came up with some of those poor
creatures, who were then making a halt, and kneeling in the street,
whilst a friar from a high cross, with an image of our LORD crucified
in his hand, was preaching to them and the populace with great
vehemence. Sermon being ended, the penitents went forwards, and several
companies followed after with their respective preaching friars at
their head, bearing crucifixes. These they pointed to and brandished
frequently, and the hearers as frequently beat their breasts, and
clapped their cheeks. At proper pauses they stopped and prayed, and
one of them, more zealous than the rest, before the King’s palace,
sounded the word _penitentia_ through a speaking trumpet. The
penitents themselves were clothed and covered all over with white linen
vestments, only holes were made for their eyes to peep out at. All were
bare-footed, and all had long heavy chains fastened to their ancles,
which, when dragged along the street, made a dismal rattling: but
though alike in dress, yet in other respects there was great variety
amongst them. For some carried great stones on their backs, and
others dead mens bones and skulls in their hands. Some bore large and
seemingly very heavy crosses upon their shoulders, whilst others had
their arms extended quite wide, or carried a bow full of swords with
the points downwards. Most of them whipped and lashed themselves, some
with cords, and others with flat bits of iron. It being a moonshine
night, I could see them quite well; and indeed some of them struck so
hard, that I perceived their backs (left bare on purpose to be slashed)
were quite red, and swoln very much by the violence and repetition of
the blows. Had my dear friend been there, he would have joined with me
in saying, that the whole scene was horrible;――so horrible, that, being
informed it was to be continued till morning, I was glad to return from
whence I came about midnight.――――Had you been with me, I know you would
have joined with me in praising and gratefully adoring the LORD of
all lords, for the great wonder of the reformation, and also for that
glorious deliverance wrought out for us a few years past, in defeating
the unnatural rebellion. O what a mighty spirit and power from on high
must _Luther_, _Calvin_, _Melancthon_, _Zuinglius_, and those glorious
reformers, be necessarily endued with, who dared first openly to oppose
and stem such a torrent of superstition and spiritual tyranny! and what
gratitude owe we to those, who, under GOD, were instrumental in saving
us from the return of such spiritual slavery, and such blind obedience
to a papal power! To have had a papist for our king;――a papist, if
not born, yet from his infancy nursed up at _Rome_;――a papist, one of
whose sons is advanced to the ecclesiastical dignity of a Cardinal, and
both under the strongest obligations to support the interest of that
church, whose superstitions, as well as political state principles,
they have sucked in, and imbibed even from their infancy. But, blessed
be GOD, the snare is broken, and we are delivered. O for protestant
practices to be added to protestant principles! O for an obediential
acknowledgment to the ever-blessed GOD for our repeated deliverances!
But alas!――――Pardon me, my dear friend, I stop to weep. Adieu. I cannot
enlarge, but leaving you to guess from what source my tears flow, I
must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear Sir,

               Yours most cordially in our blessed LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

THE time of our departure hence is just at hand. I cannot move without
sending you a few lines; I remember your unmerited love, I remember
our affectionate parting, and I trust feel the benefit of your distant
prayers. Though called to part with what is dearer to me than life, yet
my heavenly Father hath not left me comfortless. True, it is a silent,
but I hope an instructive period of life. One must be all eye and ear
at _Lisbon_:――and indeed, I would not but have seen and heard what
hath passed here, since our arrival, upon any account. It surpasseth
all description. Surely _England_, and _English_ privileges civil and
religious, will be dearer to me than ever. The preachers here have also
taught me something; their action is graceful. _Vividi oculi,――vividæ
manus,――omnia vivida._ Surely our _English_ preachers would do well,
to be a little more fervent in their address. They have truth on their
side, why should superstition and falshood run away with all that is
pathetic and affecting? But my dear friend needs not this note. Blessed
be GOD for making you fervent in spirit. Go on, my dear Sir, in the
name and strength of JESUS. _Sequar, etsi non passibus æquis.――Nil
desperandum Christo duce._ Pray remember me to all that love him, and
are so kind as to enquire after a worthless worm for his great name’s
sake. It will be an act of the greatest charity to intercede in my
behalf. Alas! alas! I am a dwarf indeed. My dear Sir, pray that I may
grow, I cannot bear to live at this dying rate. I want to be a flame of
fire. That this may be your happy lot, is and shall be, through CHRIST
strengthening me, the earnest request of, my very dear Sir,

            Your most unworthy, though affectionate friend,
           brother, and fellow-labourer in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Lisbon, April 9, 1754._

_Dear Madam_,

I HOPE this will find you more than happy, in the enjoyment of Him,
whose death and passion many at this season are peculiarly called upon
to remember, and be thankful for. Vast are the outward preparations
made here. Altars upon altars are erecting. Penitents upon penitents
are walking and lashing themselves: but what I want to have erected
and adorned, is an altar in my heart, and the blows and lashes I desire
to feel, are the crucifixion and mortification of the old man and its
deeds. Without this, all is mere parade. GOD be praised for opening
your eyes, and teaching you the holy art of worshipping him in spirit
and in truth. Is it not a glorious privilege? Would you lose it for
ten thousand worlds? Blessed be GOD, it is in safe hands! The life of
a believer is a hidden life; a life hid with CHRIST in GOD. May the
Author and Finisher thereof, cause it to open and be displayed more and
more every hour and every moment in your heart! Thus prays, dear Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                            _Lisbon, April 10, 1754._

_My very dear Friend_,

STILL I am here, surrounded with every thing, in an ecclesiastical
way, that can offend a mind which desires to worship the LORD JESUS
in outward as well as inward simplicity. To-morrow is what they call
_Holy Thursday_. May I be as solicitous to have my heart illuminated
by the spirit of GOD, as the people here are to illuminate their
churches and altars. The pageantry is indeed incredible. Though we
have been detained longer than expectation, yet I trust what I have
seen and heard, will do me service in the future part of my life.
Was I returning to, as I am going from _England_, and had I a proper
companion, I would make a tour to _Leghorn_, _Genoa_, _Rome_, &c. and
so to _Marseilles_. What instruction would such a mind as yours gather
from such various scenes? O that I may be like a busy bee, and suck
some honey even from superstitious flowers! I do not wonder now, whence
the illuminations, dressing of altars, and those other things which
I have lately mentioned in a public manner on another occasion, took
their birth. It is all in imitation of what is daily practised abroad.
May the LORD JESUS crush the cockatrice in its egg, and prevent its
growing any bigger! I write this from a merchant’s house, who sent for
me from on board. Thus our LORD provides for those that are employed
for him. Help me to praise him. My fatherless charge are all well.
In a day or two we expect to sail. My most cordial respects attend
your mother, and all your dear relations. Continue to pray for me,
and thereby add to the obligations already conferred on, my very dear
friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

PROVIDENCE still detains us at _Lisbon_, and therefore I know you will
be enquiring what more news from thence?――Truly, as extraordinary as
ever――for I have now seen the solemnities of an _Holy-Thursday_, which
is a very high day in this metropolis, and particularly remarkable for
the grand illuminations of the churches, and the king’s washing twelve
poor men’s feet.――Through the interest of a friend, I got admittance
into the gallery where the ceremony was performed. It was large, and
hung with tapestry; one piece of which represented the humble JESUS
washing the feet of his disciples.――Before this, upon a small eminence,
sat twelve men in black. At the upper end, and in several other parts
of the gallery, were side-boards of large gold and silver basons and
ewers most curiously wrought; and near these a large table covered
with a variety of dishes, all cold, set off and garnished after the
_Portuguese_ fashion. Public high mass being over, his majesty came in
attended with his nobles, who seemed to me to look like so many _Roman_
senators. The act of washing the feet, I did not get in time enough to
see; but that being ended, several of the young noblemen served up the
dishes to the king’s brother and uncles; these again handed them to
his majesty, who gave (I think) twelve of them in all to each poor man.
Every thing was carried on with a great deal of decency and good humour.
The young noblemen served very chearfully, their seniors looked quite
pleased, and the king and his royal relations behaved in a very polite,
easy manner,――upon the whole, though as you may easily guess it was
not an exact copy of the tapestry, yet, as the poor mens cloaths and
food, when sold, came to about ten moidores; and as there was little
mixture of superstition in it, I cannot say but I was as well pleased
with my morning’s entertainment as with any thing I had seen since my
arrival.――I believe the whole took up near two hours. After dinner we
went to see the churches; but the ♦magnificence and sumptuousness of
the furniture, cannot well be expressed.――Many of them were hung on
the occasion with purple damask trimmed with gold.――In one of them
there was a solid silver altar of several yards circumference, and near
twelve steps high: and in another a gold one, still more magnificent,
of about the same dimensions.――Its basis was studded with many precious
stones, and near the top were placed silver images, in representation
of angels. Each step was filled with large silver candlesticks, with
wax-tapers in them, which going up by a regular ascent, ’till they
formed themselves into a pyramid, made a most glittering and splendid
blaze.――The great altars also of the other churches were illuminated
most profusely, and silver pots of artificial flowers, with a large
wax-taper between each, were fixed all round several of them.――Between
these, were large paintings in black and white, representing the
different parts of our Saviour’s passion. And, in short, all was so
magnificently, so superstitiously grand, that I am persuaded several
thousands of pounds would not defray the expences of this one day.
Go which way you would, nothing was to be seen but illuminations
within, and hurry without.――For all persons, princes and crowned
heads themselves not excepted, are obliged on this day to visit seven
churches or altars, in imitation, as is supposed, of our LORD’s being
hurried from one tribunal to another, before he was condemned to be
hung upon the cross.――I saw the queen pass by in great state to visit
three of them. Velvet cushions were carried before her Majesty, and
boards laid along the streets for herself and retinue to walk upon.
Guards attended before and behind, and thousands of spectators stood
on each side to gaze at them as they passed along. Being desirous of
seeing the manner of their entrance, we got into the last church before
they came. It was that of _St. Domingo_, where was the gold altar
before mentioned, and at which her Majesty and train knelt about a
quarter of an hour.――All the while, the _Dominican_ friars sung most
surprisingly sweet. But as I stood near the altar, over against the
great door, I must confess my very inmost soul was struck with a secret
horror, when, upon looking up, I saw over the front of the great window
of the church, the heads of many hundred _Jews_, painted on canvas,
who had been condemned by what they call the _Holy Inquisition_,
and carried out from that church to be burnt.――Strange way this, of
compelling people to come in! Such was not thy method, O meek and
compassionate Lamb of GOD! Thou camest not to destroy mens lives,
but to save them.――But bigotry is as cruel as the grave.――It knows
no remorse.――From all its bitter and dire effects, good LORD deliver
us!――But to return to the Queen. Having performed her devotions, she
departed and went in a coach of state, I believe, directly from the
church to her palace, and without doubt sufficiently fatigued: for,
besides walking through the streets to the several churches, her
Majesty also, and the princesses, had been engaged in waiting upon,
and washing the feet of twelve poor women, in as public a manner as
the king. In our walk home, we met his Majesty with his brother and
two uncles, attended only with a few noblemen in black velvet, and
a few guards without halberts. I suppose he was returning from his
last church, and, as one may well imagine, equally fatigued with his
royal consort and daughters.――When church and state thus combine to be
nursing fathers and nursing mothers to superstition, is it any wonder
that its credit and influence is so diffusive among the populace?――O
_Britain! Britain!_ hast thou but zeal proportionable to thy knowledge,
and inward purity adequate to the simplicity of thy external worship,
in what a happy and god-like situation wouldst thou be! Here I could
weep again.――Again I leave you to guess the cause; and if I can send
you one more letter of a like nature, before we leave this place, it is
all you must expect from, my dear friend,

              Your’s most assuredly in our glorious Head,

                                            _Lisbon, April 12, 1755._

_My dear Friend_,

AFTER the news already sent you, I thought our _Lisbon_ correspondence
would entirely have been put a stop to; for upon returning to my
lodgings, (as weary I believe as others that had been running from
church to church all day) word was sent me, that our ship would
certainly sail the next morning. This news, I own, was not altogether
agreeable to me, because I wanted to see the conclusion of the _Lent_
solemnities. However, I made ready; and having dispatched my private
affairs the over-night, was conducted very early in the morning, by my
kind host, down to _Bellem_, where the ship lay. We parted. The wind
promised to be fair; but dying away, I very eagerly went ashore once
more. But how was the scene changed! Before, all used to be noise and
hurry;――now, all was hushed and shut up in the most awful and profound
silence. No clock or bell had been heard since yesterday noon, and
scarce a person was to be seen in the street all the way to _Lisbon_.
About two in the afternoon we got to the place, where (I had heard
some days ago) an extraordinary scene was to be exhibited. Can you
guess what it was?――Perhaps not. Why then I will tell you. “It was the
crucifixion of the Son of GOD, represented partly by dumb images, and
partly by living persons, in a large church belonging to the convent of
_St. De Beato_.” Several thousands crouded into it; some of whom, as I
was told, had been waiting there from even six in the morning.――Through
the kind interposition and assistance of a protestant or two, I was not
only admitted into the church, but was very commodiously situated to
view the whole performance. We had not waited long before the curtain
was drawn up. Immediately, upon a high scaffold hung in the front
with black bays, and behind with silk purple damask laced with gold,
was exhibited to our view an image of the LORD JESUS at full length,
crowned with thorns, and nailed on a cross between two figures of like
dimensions, representing the two thieves. At a little distance on the
right hand, was placed an image of the virgin _Mary_, in plain long
ruffles, and a kind of widow-weeds. Her veil was purple silk, and she
had a wire glory round her head.――At the foot of the cross lay, in a
mournful pensive posture, a living man, dressed in woman’s cloaths,
who personated _Mary Magdalen_; and not far off stood a young man, in
imitation of the beloved disciple.――He was dressed in a loose green
silk vesture, and bob-wig.――His eyes were fixed on the cross, and his
two hands a little extended. On each side, near the front of the stage,
stood two centinels in buff, with formidable caps and long beards; and
directly in the front stood another yet more formidable, with a large
target in his hand. We may suppose him to be the _Roman_ centurion.
To compleat the scene, from behind the purple hangings came out about
twenty little purple-vested winged boys, two by two, each bearing
a lighted wax-taper in his hand, and a crimson and gold cap on his
head.――At their entrance upon the stage, they gently bowed their heads
to the spectators, then kneeled and made obeisance, first to the image
on the cross, and then to that of the virgin _Mary_.――When risen, they
bowed to each other, and then took their respective places over-against
one another, on steps assigned for them at the front of the stage.
Opposite to this, at a few yards distance, stood a black friar in a
pulpit hung in mourning. For a while he paused, and then, breaking
silence, gradually lifted up his voice ’till it was extended to a
pretty high pitch, though I think scarce high enough for so large an
auditory. After he had proceeded in his discourse about a quarter of
an hour, a confused noise was heard near the front great door; upon
turning my head, I saw four long-bearded men, two of which carried
a ladder on their shoulders, and after them followed two more with
large gilt dishes in their hands, full of linen, spices, &c. These (as
I imagined) were the representatives of _Nicodemus_ and _Joseph_ of
_Arimathea_. On a signal given from the pulpit, they advanced towards
the steps of the scaffold. But upon their very first attempting to
mount it, at the watchful centurion’s nod, the observant soldiers made
a pass at them, and presented the points of their javelins directly to
their breasts. They are repulsed. Upon this a letter from _Pilate_ is
produced. The centurion reads it, shakes his head, and with looks that
bespoke a forced compliance, beckons to the centinels to withdraw their
arms. Leave being thus obtained, they ascend; and having paid their
homage, by kneeling first to the image on the cross, and then to
the virgin _Mary_, they retired to the back of the stage. Still the
preacher continued declaiming, or rather (as was said) explaining
the mournful scene. _Magdalen_ persists in wringing her hands, and
variously expressing her personated sorrow; whilst _John_ (seemingly
regardless of all besides) stood gazing on the crucified figure. By
this time it was near three o’clock, and therefore proper for the scene
to begin to close. The ladders are ascended, the superscription and
crown of thorns taken off, long white rollers put round the arms of the
image, and then the nails knocked out which fastened the hands and feet.
Here _Mary Magdalen_ looks most languishing, and _John_, if possible,
stands more thunder-struck than before.――The orator lifts up his voice,
and almost all the hearers expressed concern by weeping, beating their
breasts, and smiting their cheeks.――At length the body is gently let
down. _Magdalen_ eyes it, and, gradually rising, receives the feet
into her wide-spread handkerchief; whilst _John_ (who hitherto stood
motionless like a statue) as the body came nearer the ground, with an
eagerness that bespoke the intense affection of a sympathizing friend,
runs towards the cross, seizes the upper part of it into his clasping
arms, and, with his disguised fellow-mourner, helps to bear it away.
And here the play should end, was I not afraid you would be angry with
me, if I did not give you an account of the last act, by telling you
what became of the corpse after it was taken down. Great preparations
were made for its interment. It was wrapped in linen and spices, &c.
and being laid upon a bier richly hung, was afterwards carried round
the church-yard in grand procession. The image of the virgin _Mary_ was
chief mourner, and _John_ and _Magdalen_, with a whole troop of friars
with wax-tapers in their hands, followed after. Determined to see the
whole, I waited its return, and in about a quarter of an hour the corps
was brought in, and deposited in an open sepulchre prepared for the
purpose; but not before a priest, accompanied by several of the same
order in splendid vestments, had perfumed it with incense, sung to and
kneeled before it. _John_ and _Magdalen_ attended the obsequies; but
the image of the virgin _Mary_ was carried away and placed upon the
front of the stage, in order to be kissed, adored, and worshipped by
the people.――This I saw them do with the utmost eagerness and reverence.
And thus ended this _Good Friday_’s tragi-comical, superstitious,
idolatrous farce. A farce, which whilst I saw, as well as now whilst I
am describing it, excited in me an high indignation.――Surely, thought
I, whilst attending on such a scene of mock devotion, if ever, now
is the dear LORD JESUS crucified afresh; and I could then, and even
now, think of no other plea for the poor beguiled devotees, than that
which suffering innocence put up himself for his enemies, when actually
hanging upon the cross, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.” There was but one thing wanting to raise one’s resentment
to the highest pitch, and that was, for one of the soldiers to have
pierced the side of the image upon the cross. This in all probability
you have heard hath actually been done in other places, and with a
little more art, might, I think, have been performed here. Doubtless it
would have afforded the preacher as good, if not a better opportunity
of working upon the passions of his auditory, than the taking down the
superscription and crown of thorns, and wiping the head with a blooded
cloth, and afterwards exposing it to the view of the people; all which
I saw done before the body was let down.――But alas! my dear friend, how
mean is that eloquence, and how entirely destitute of the demonstration
of the spirit, and of a divine power, must that oratory necessarily
be, that stands in need of such a train of superstitious pageantry
to render it impressive!――Think you, my dear friend, that the apostle
_Paul_ used or needed any such artifices to excite the passions of the
people of _Galatia_, amongst whom, as he himself informs us, “JESUS
CHRIST was crucified, and evidently set forth?”――But thus it is, and
thus it will be, when simplicity and spirituality are banished from our
religious offices, and artifice and idolatry seated in their room.――I
am well aware that the _Romanists_ deny the charge of idolatry; but
after having seen what I have seen this day, as well as at sundry other
times since my arrival here, I cannot help thinking but a person must
be capable of making more than metaphysical distinctions, and deal in
very abstract ideas indeed, fairly to evade the charge.――If weighed
in the balance of the sanctuary, I am positive the scale must turn
on the protestant side.――But such a balance these poor people are not
permitted to make use of! Doth not your heart bleed for them? Mine
doth I am sure, and I believe would do so more and more, was I to stay
longer, and see what they call their _Hallelujah_, and grand devotions
on _Easter-day_.――But that scene is denied me.――The wind is fair, and I
must away.――Follow me with your prayers, and believe me to be, my dear
friend,

          Yours most affectionately, in our common Redeemer,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear sister in CHRIST_,

IT really hath given me much concern since I have been on the mighty
waters, that it was not in my power to write to you more frequently
when on shore. I therefore send you a few lines from the great deep,
which I hope will find you magnifying the LORD, and rejoicing in
GOD your Saviour. For his great name’s sake, I am once more going to
_Georgia_, and after a short tour through some parts of _America_, I
hope to see my native country, and begin to begin to ramble after poor
sinners again. In our way we touched at _Lisbon_, which I hope hath
been blessed to me, so far as to make me prize protestant liberty and
simplicity more than ever. Fain would I be one of CHRIST’s bees, and
learn to extract honey from every flower. But alas! I am a drone, and
deserve to be stung out of GOD’s hive. But he is gracious and long
suffering. O eternity! How do I long to praise my GOD there! We are
within a few hundred miles of our earthly, but when I shall arrive at
my heavenly port GOD only knows. Strange! that I should be kept out
at sea so long. I am now near forty. Father, thy will be done! Only
vouchsafe to employ me, and then――――I can no more. The Redeemer is
pleased to fill my soul. Help me to cry Grace! Grace! and believe me
to be,

                     Your most assured friend, and
                   ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                _On board the Success, May 12, 1754._

_Dear Mrs. S――――_,

I FULLY purposed to have written to you from _Lisbon_, but was so taken
up in seeing the ecclesiastical curiosities of the place, and was so
suddenly called away, that rendered it impracticable.――However, that
I may not be disappointed again, I sit down to write you a few lines,
though about eight hundred miles off shore. May they find you as to
spirituals, in the same situation as is our ship in a natural respect,
gently, sweetly gliding towards your heavenly harbour, under a pleasant
gale of divine influence. Or,

                _If rough and stormy be your way_,
  Fear not――――  _Only to JESUS cry, and say_,
                _Be strength proportion’d to my day_.

You will find him a kind and faithful Saviour. Whom he loves, he loves
to the end. He hath already delivered you out of the paw of the bear
and of the lion, and he will also deliver out of the hand of every
remaining _Goliah_. Courage, then, my dear Mrs. _S――――_, courage. The
crown is before you, and ere long JESUS will put it on your head. I
hope all your houshold, as well as yourself, have this in full view. It
glitters, though at this distance. O how bright and radiant! Purchased
at how dear a rate! It is worth striving for. The LORD help you all to
strive so as to obtain. So wishes and prays, dear Mrs. _S――――_,

          Your assured friend and servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

JUST now, through the tender mercies of a never-failing GOD, we saw the
_American_ shore, and are within a few miles of our desired port. The
wind being contrary, we cannot enter it; I will therefore employ a few
minutes in answering your last kind letter. It was full of christian
love, and bespoke a heart deeply engaged for the success of the gospel
in _Gloucestershire_. I hope it runs and is glorified, and trust ere
now you find that the blessed Redeemer stands in no need of such a
wretch as I am. Fear not, our LORD will never want instruments to carry
on his work.――A heavenly fire is lighted in _England_, which men and
devils shall never be able to extinguish. I pray for its spreading
night and day; receive this as a token that none of you are forgotten
by me before the LORD. I believe we have fared the better for your
prayers. Our passage hath been pleasant, and assure yourselves, I
shall make all possible dispatch in order to return unto you. O that
it may be in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of CHRIST. Pray
remember me to Mr. _R―――― C――――_, to your wife, and all those dear
souls, amongst whom, when last in _Gloucestershire_, GOD gave us a
heaven upon earth. O for a heaven in heaven! Blessed be GOD, that port
is in view. From thence we shall never put to sea any more. Adieu. I
cannot enlarge. Continue to pray for me, as a poor travelling pilgrim,
but, for CHRIST’s sake,

                      Yours most affectionately,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

THROUGH the divine goodness, we are just now sailing into our harbour,
after having been six weeks from _Lisbon_.――Providentially a ship goes
out to-morrow for _Cowes_; I cannot omit the opportunity of sending you
a few friendly lines. They come from a friend, and leave him leaning
on Him who hath promised never to forsake those that put their trust
in him. Our passage hath been very easy, only our entrance into the
harbour (like our last struggle before we enter heaven) hath been
somewhat troublesome. May the LORD of all Lords give you, and yours,
and all my never to be forgotten _Yorkshire_ friends, an abundant
entrance there! I must not think of you too much; parting seasons would
come too fresh in my mind.――O blessed season, when we shall part no
more! Adieu, adieu. I hope to write soon again. My orphan-charge are
all quite well, and I hope in a few days to see them safe at _Georgia_.
I know whose company would be acceptable to all there; but,――Father thy
will be done! I can no more. Accept this as a token of love unfeigned,
from, my dear friend,

             Yours for ever and ever, in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

SINCE I left _Bethesda_, I have been out two nights by land, and one
by water, and though wearied, am preserved in as good health as can in
any wise be expected. To-morrow or _Monday_, I expect to embark again
for _New-York_. The prospect of being ere long at the new _Jerusalem_,
makes all things easy. I thank you for your kind letter, and for
regarding my tears. They speak better than words. JESUS knows they
were shed for him, and for the welfare of that institution which has
lain so many years upon my poor heart. Have a little patience, and you
will find more and more, that your coming over the water was of GOD.
I wish it was in my power to make every thing more than agreeable; our
common LORD I trust will do it himself. This is my heart’s desire, and
shall be my constant prayer night and day. You will see what I have
sent by this opportunity. Whatever of the linen or woollen stuff you
would have made up for the children, may be sent by those who bring
this; and what you want done in this way, only let Mrs. _B――――_ have a
line, and orders will be readily executed. Thus GOD raises up friends.
The LORD be with you all. Help me to praise him, and continue to pray
for, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

               Your unworthy friend, and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

THOUGH I hear that Captain _Thompson_ does not sail, these three weeks,
yet as I am bound for the northward, I cannot help leaving a few
grateful lines behind me. May they find you leaning on the ever-loving,
ever-lovely JESUS, and determined through his strength steadily to
pursue that one thing needful, which shall never be taken from you! My
prayers are continually ascending in your behalf;――they are your due; I
owe you, and shall owe you much love as long as I live. By this I send
you most grateful acknowledgments for all favours,――they are many, but
all noted in my Master’s book. How are my obligations to love and serve
him increased! He gave us a pleasant passage, and I trust hath blessed
my ministry to some souls since my arrival, and also hath given me
to leave my orphan-charge in comfortable circumstances; the family
now consists of above an hundred. He that fed the multitude in the
wilderness, can and will feed the orphans in _Georgia_. Your letters
I delivered, and I suppose you will receive proper answers.――But
I find Mr. _H――――_ doth not trade at _Lisbon_, and Mr. _H――――m_ is
about to leave off business and retire. Happy they who can do this,
and at the same time that they retire from the world, retire into
GOD. His presence is all in all. That you may be blessed with a
plentiful portion of it here, and be admitted to an infinitely greater
participation of it hereafter, is the earnest prayer of, very dear Sir,

             Your most obliged friend, and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                               _On board the Deborah, July 20, 1754._

_My dear Friend_,

I DO not forget my promise, though hurrying from place to place,
and settling my orphan-charge, hath almost put it out of my power to
perform it: however, I am now once more on the great deep in my way to
_New-York_; accept a few lines as a token that you are not forgotten
by me. I wrote to you from _Lisbon_. From thence we had a pleasant
passage to _Carolina_, and since that I found and left my orphan family
comfortably settled at _Georgia_. The colony, as well as _Bethesda_,
is now in a thriving situation. Black and white persons I have now a
hundred and six to provide for. The GOD whom I desire to serve, will
enable me to do it for his great name’s sake. At _Charles-Town_, and
in other parts of _Carolina_, my poor labours have met with the usual
acceptance, and I have reason to hope a clergyman hath been brought
under very serious impressions. Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me,
but unto thy free grace be all the glory! What will befal me at the
northward, I know not; this I know, that JESUS CHRIST will suffer
nothing to pluck me out of his hands. My health is wonderfully
preserved.――My wonted vomitings have left me, and though I ride whole
nights, and have been frequently exposed to great thunders, violent
lightnings, and heavy rains, yet I am rather better than usual, and as
far as I can judge, am not yet to die. O that I may at length learn to
begin to live. I am ashamed of my sloth and lukewarmness, and long to
be on the stretch for GOD. I hope this will find you thus employed. My
cordial love awaits your whole self, your brother, Mr. _B――――_, and in
short all the followers of the blessed Lamb of GOD. Though unworthy of
their notice, I earnestly intreat a continued interest in their prayers,
as being, my very dear Sir,

                Their and your affectionate friend, and
                   ready servant in our common LORD,

                            _To Mr. D――――._

                               _On board the Deborah, July 20, 1754._

_My very dear Mr. D――――_,

THIS leaves me on my way towards _New-York_. Accept this as a token,
that change of climate doth not cause a change of affection. No, you
and my other dear _Edinburgh_ friends are still upon my heart, and I
trust will remain fixed there, till we meet to join the singing choir
that is about the throne. I hope you have an earnest and anticipation
of this, every _Monday_ evening. I hope you enjoy a feeling possession
of your GOD, every day and every hour. This will make the most barren
wilderness to smile, and support you under the most distressing
circumstances. It is this that supports me by land and by water.
Without it, what could such a poor, weak, faint-hearted pilgrim do?
Verily I should faint.――But as yet I cannot die. In spite of thunder,
lightning, rain, and heat, GOD is pleased to hold my soul in life, and
to let me see his glorious work prosper in my unworthy hands. _Georgia_
and _Bethesda_ I found in a thriving way. My family consists of a
hundred and six, and will prove I trust of more extensive use every day.
About six weeks I staid at _Carolina_ and _Georgia_. One is likely to
be settled as minister in _Charles-Town_. There my poor labours have
met with usual acceptance, and I live in hopes of some gracious gales
to the northward. Perhaps about _Christmas_, or early in the spring,
I may see my native country again.――O may I return grown in grace, and
in the knowledge of my LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST! But I am a dwarf.
Pray, pray for me. Accept unfeigned thanks for all favours, remember me
in the kindest manner to all inquiring friends, and believe me to be,
my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER ML.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _New-York, July 27, 1754._

_My very dear and steady Friend_,

HERE will I set up my _Ebenezer_――for hitherto the LORD hath helped me.
Through his divine goodness, I left _Georgia_ and _Bethesda_ in growing
circumstances, and am come once more to pay a short visit to the
northward. O that the Redeemer may make it a sweet one! Some time
next month, perhaps I may have the pleasure of seeing you and yours,
and my other dear _Boston_ friends. As I am entirely unprovided with
travelling furniture, I have thoughts of coming as far as _Rhode-island_
by water. GOD willing, you shall have timely notice, or it may be, I
may come upon you unawares. Strange! that I should be in this dying
world till now. What changes have I seen! What changes must I expect to
see before my final departure, if the Redeemer is pleased to lengthen
out this span of life. Welcome, welcome, my LORD and my GOD, whatever
cup thou shalt see meet to put into my hands! Only sweeten it with thy
love, and then, though bitter in itself, it cannot but be salutary.
Alas! how little do we know of ourselves, till we are tried, and how
hard doth the old man die! Well! blessed be GOD, die he shall. JESUS
hath given him his deadly blow, and at the best he only lives a dying
life. Thanks be to GOD for such a Saviour! O for a thousand tongues to
shew forth his praise! LORD JESUS, cloath me with humility, that I may
every day know more and more the honour conferred upon me in being made
a poor pilgrim for thee! Keep me travelling, keep me working, or at
least beginning to begin to work for thee till I die! But whither am
I going? Excuse me, my dear Sir.――I am writing to a beloved _Gaius_.
GOD bless you and yours.――My most cordial respects await all enquiring
friends.――Methinks they are dearer than ever to, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MLI.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                           _New-York, July 28, 1754._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

ONCE more, the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS hath brought me hither,
and last night gave me an opportunity of recommending his dying love.
When I ascended the pulpit, and found your place empty, I was somewhat
affected; but I have met with so many changes in the church as well
as the world, that it is time for me to begin to learn to be surprized
at nothing. Some time next month, I hope to come as far as _Boston_.
I know, my dear Sir, that you will pray, it may be in the fulness of
the blessing of the gospel of CHRIST. What is to befall me I know not;
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit! Fain would I be as clay in
thy hands. LORD JESUS, when shall it once be? But I am a stubborn, ill
and hell-deserving creature. Less than the least of all, shall be my
motto still. Amazing,――that the Redeemer should suffer such a wretch to
speak or travel for him. Surely his name and nature is Love. O that I
could but begin to begin to love him! My obligations increase daily. In
_England_ the word of the LORD runs and is glorified indeed. _Georgia_
and _Bethesda_ I left in growing circumstances. The orphan-family now
consists of one hundred and six, black and white. A young man that hath
been a student there, succeeds Mr. _S――――_ of _Charles-Town_. O that
the Redeemer may provide for the dear _New-York_ people! The residue
of the spirit is in his hands. LORD JESUS, make their extremity thy
opportunity to help and relieve them! But I shall weary you, and detain
you too long from more important work. May the great head of divine
influence bless you and yours, and all your present flock! Some of them
I know. If you should see dear Mr. _P――――_ or _F――――_, be so good as to
remember me to them, in the most respectful manner.――I intreat their
prayers for a poor but willing pilgrim, and am, reverend and very dear
Sir,

           Your most affectionate, obliged, though unworthy
                brother and servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLII.


                           _To Mr. S.――――._

                                           _New-York, July 28, 1754._

_My very dear Sir_,

HERE our LORD brought me two days ago, and last night I had an
opportunity of preaching on his dying, living, ascending, and
interceding love, to a large and attentive auditory. Next week I
purpose going to _Philadelphia_, and then shall come back again here
in my way to _Boston_. Whether I shall then return to _Bethesda_, or
embark for _England_, is uncertain.――I fear matters will not be settled
at the orphan-house, unless I go once more; I have put some upon their
trial, and shall want to see how they behave. During my passage from
_Charles-Town_, I left a few lines for you; I thought to have written
an account of _Bethesda_ for the press, but could by no means get
freedom. GOD’s time is the best. I owe for three of the negroes who
were lately bought, but hope to be enabled to pay for them at my return
from the northward. My GOD can, and will supply all my wants, according
to his riches in JESUS. Glory be to his great name, he hath now taught
me a little to be alone. His presence keeps me company, and I find it
sweet to run about for him. I find the door all along the continent
is as open as ever, and the way seems clearing up for the neighbouring
islands. What a pity is it, that we can only be at one place at once,
for the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. Had I a good private hand, I
could send you the account of my family, &c. but perhaps I may deliver
it to you myself. LORD JESUS, direct my goings in thy way! I owe you
much, yea very much love; but a pepper-corn of acknowledgment, and my
poor prayers, is all the payment that I fear will be made by, my very
dear Sir,

          Your worthless, though most obliged, affectionate,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLIII.


                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                           _New-York, July 30, 1754._

_My very dear Friend_,

SHALL we once more see each other in the flesh? I hope so.――To-morrow,
GOD willing, I preach at _Newark_; on _Wednesday_, two in the afternoon,
at _New-Brunswick_; and hope to reach _Trent-Town_ that night.
Could you not meet me there quietly, that we might spend one evening
together? You must bring a chair;――I have no horse, and will then once
more venture your throwing me down. Mr. _V――――_ passes me from hence
to _Brunswick_, and Mr. _S――――_ to _Trent-Town_. If you cannot come, I
will get Mr. _S――――_ to carry me on till we meet you. O that the LORD
JESUS may smile on my feeble labours. Here I trust he hath given us a
blessing. Yesterday I preached thrice: this morning I feel it. Welcome
weariness for JESUS! O how little can I do for him! I blush and am
confounded. Pray heartily for me; and if business will permit, come
away to, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLIV.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                      _Philadelphia, August 7, 1754._

_My dear Mr. R――――_,

I ONCE thought to write you a long letter, but it pleased GOD to cut
off my strength in my journey. Yesterday I was taken with a violent
cholera morbus, and hoped ere now to have been where the inhabitants
shall no more say, “I am sick.” But I am brought back again. May it
be in order to bring some more precious souls to the ever-blessed
JESUS! This is all my desire. O that GOD should ever make use of such
a worthless creature as I am! But his grace is free, he yet blesses me,
and rather more than ever. My poor labours, seem to be owned here, as
well as at _New-York_. I received the sacrament at church on _Sunday_,
and have preached in the academy; but I find Mr. _Tennent_’s house
abundantly more commodious. I fear it will be impossible for me to come
your way. This is the believer’s comfort, all GOD’s people shall meet
in heaven. There I hope to see you and yours. Accept hearty love, and
fail not to pray for, my dear Mr. _R――――_,

                      Yours most affectionately,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MLV.


                            _To Mr. V――――._

                                     _Philadelphia, August 15, 1754._

_My very dear Mr. V――――_,

ONCE more, after having my cables out ready (as I thought) to cast
anchor within the port, I am constrained to put out to sea again. My
late sickness, though violent, hath not been unto death. O that it may
be to the glory of GOD! With some difficulty I can preach once a-day.
Congregations rather increase than decrease; and many, O strange! are
desirous of my making a longer stay. But the time is fixed for next
_Tuesday_, and all the following days till _Sunday_, are to be employed
between this and _New-Brunswick_. There I am informed some execution
was done. Whilst I live, LORD JESUS, grant I may not live in vain. I
could enlarge, but really am so faint, that I have been obliged to stop,
and can now with difficulty subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLVI.


                            _To Mr. E――――._

                                     _Philadelphia, August 17, 1754._

_My dear Mr. E――――_,

I HOPE this will find you fairly thrust out into the highways and
hedges, and under a divine commission to compel many poor sinners to
come in. Fear not. JESUS will take care of body and soul.

                  Fix on his work thy stedfast eye,
                  So shall thy work be done.

Was you on this side the water, you would find work enough. Here’s
a glorious range in the _American_ woods. It is pleasant hunting for
sinners. Thousands flock daily to hear the word preached. Let us pray
for each other. When we meet, we may talk more together. In the mean
while, I recommend you to the unerring guidance and protection of the
great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, as being, for his great name’s sake,
my dear friend,

               Yours affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLVII.


                           _To Mrs. S――――._

                                           _New-York, Sept. 2, 1754._

_Dear Mrs. S――――_,

I AM much, yea very much indebted to you for your works of faith, and
the labours which, I believe, have proceeded from unfeigned love to the
ever-loving and ever-lovely JESUS. Put all to his account. You shall
be rewarded at the resurrection of the just: then shall the righteous
shine forth like the sun, O happy, happy time! LORD JESUS, hasten it!
May the blessed Spirit prepare us to meet him! Methinks I hear you say,
“I will not lose a moment.” The LORD strengthen you in this and every
holy resolution! You must pray that I may not flag in the latter stages
of my road. Blessed be GOD, we had good seasons between _Philadelphia_
and _New-York_. In the _New-Jerusalem_ more glorious seasons await us
yet. At present I can no more. Be pleased to remember me in the kindest
manner to all, and believe me to be, dear Mr. _S――――_,

       Your assured friend, and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLVIII.


                                       _New-York, September 2, 1754._

_My dear Doctor_,

MAY this find you rejoicing in the holy comforts of that infinitely
great and gracious physician, to whose all-powerful blood and
righteousness, you and I are so much beholden! Surely he hath been
loving unto us. O that we may recover our first love, and return and do
our first work! JESUS is able and willing to do this for us. The return
of backsliders, and forgiving those who cannot forgive themselves, is
his heart’s delight. He spares when we deserve punishment, and in his
wrath thinketh upon mercy. Fly then, my dear friend, to his loving arms
and heart; he waits to be gracious. Let us wait on him in the way of
duty, and we shall find that his arm is not shortened, but that he is
still able and willing to save to the uttermost all that come to the
Father through him. LORD JESUS, who can tell how far _thy uttermost_
extendeth! None but thy own eternal Self: surely it must extend
to the vilest of sinners, or it never could have reached ill and
hell-deserving me! Help me, my dear Sir, to cry Grace! grace! We had
pleasant seasons in our way hither, and here people attend gladly. Some
time this week I expect to sail for _Rhode-Island_. Remember a poor but
willing pilgrim, and accept this as a token, that neither you nor yours
are forgotten by, my dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLIX.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                        _Newark, September 27, 1754._

_My very dear Sir_,

THE searcher of hearts only knows what struggles and tossings your
last letter, as well as that of dear Mr. _W――――_, hath occasioned
in my breast. Affection, intense affection cries aloud, “Away to
_New-England_, to dear _New-England_ directly.” Providence, and
the circumstances of the Southern provinces, point directly towards
_Virginia_ and the Orphan-house. In the former, I am told, the door is
opening in earnest; and the business of the latter requires my presence
this Winter. These being dispatched, my mind will be disburdened, and
my heart free for a large range in _New-England_. For this, I hereby
give you and my dear never to be forgotten friends, a promissory note
of hand. _Deo volente_, I will perform it, before I leave _America_.
I think I can take shipping from _Boston_ for _England_. It will not
do to go thence to the _West-Indies_, because I cannot go without a
companion, and that companion (if possible) is to be Captain _G――――_.
These are my present thoughts. Have a little patience, and by delaying
for a short time, I shall enjoy more of my dear friends company: this
is what I want to be filled with. In the mean while, my enemies may be
preparing their artillery. I have nothing but a sling and a stone. I
trust that my determination is agreeable to the mind of JESUS. Many of
his true ministers have been consulted, earnest prayers have been made,
and I humbly hope the event will be glorious. What a pity is it that
we can have but one body and one soul to glorify the blessed Redeemer
with! LORD, accept my two worthless mites, and help me at length to
begin to begin to do something for thy great name’s sake! The worthy
President, who was to be my companion to _Boston_, will let you know
how affairs go. Blessed be GOD, the shout of a king hath been amongst
us. I am extremely well pleased with the synod and commencement. O that
I had wings! then would I fly, if it was only just to have a sight of
you and yours, and my dear and worthy friends.――But――I must say no more.
Pray, pray earnestly, my dear friend, for him, who is less than the
least of all, indeed and indeed, but

                    Yours most affectionately, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MLX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                        _Elizabeth-Town (New-Jersey),
                                                 September 30, 1754._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

A LITTLE before I had the favour of your Ladyship’s kind letter, I
had written from _New-York_. Since which time, I trust, through the
efficacy of divine grace, many new creatures have been formed for GOD.
Every where a divine power accompanies the word, prejudices have been
removed, and a more effectual door opened than ever for preaching the
everlasting gospel. I am now at Governor _B――――_’s, who sends your
Ladyship the most cordial respects. His outward man decays, but his
inward man seems to be renewed day by day. I think he ripens for heaven
apace. This last week was the _New-Jersey_ commencement, at which the
President and Trustees were pleased to present me with the degree of
A.M. The synod succeeded.――But such a number of simple hearted, united
ministers, I never saw before. I preached to them several times, and
the great Master of assemblies was in the midst of us. To-morrow, GOD
willing, I shall set out with the worthy President for _New-England_,
and expect to return back to the Orphan house through _Virginia_, where
the gospel I trust will have free course and be glorified. This will
be about a two thousand mile circuit; but the Redeemer’s strength will
be more than sufficient. Once this Summer, I thought my discharge was
come; but it seems the shattered bark must put out to sea again. Father,
thy will be done! I hope this will find your Ladyship safe at your
beloved _Clifton_, where you may enjoy yourself and GOD, without the
interruptions of a noisy town. This is indeed heaven upon earth. That
you and yours may enjoy it more and more every day, is and shall be the
earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

                Your Ladyship’s most obliged, dutiful,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. Z――――._

                                        _Elizabeth-Town (New-Jersey),
                                                 September 30, 1754._

_Very dear and honoured Sir_,

JUST two months ago, I arrived at _New-York_ from _South-Carolina_,
and ever since have been endeavouring to labour in my poor way for the
ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. Many things have concurred, to prove
that my coming at this time was of GOD. Sinners have been awakened,
and saints quickened, and enemies made to be at peace with me. Grace!
grace! In general, I have been enabled to travel and preach twice
a day. Every where the door hath been opened wider than ever. At
_Philadelphia_, I had a most comfortable evening with Mr. _B――――_
and his collegues; and at the _New-Jersey_ commencement I was much
refreshed with the company of a whole synod of ministers, that, I
believe, do indeed love the Redeemer in sincerity. I write this from
Governor _B――――_’s, who is indeed singularly good, and whose latter end
greatly increases as to spirituals. O that this may be my happy lot!
About a month ago, I thought my great change was coming, but I soon
was sent back to sea again. To-morrow I steer for _New-England_, and
from thence purpose returning to the Orphan-house through _Virginia_,
where the door for preaching I hear is opening wide. Sometimes I
have thoughts of going to the _West-Indies_, but fear it will not be
practicable, before I see _England_. LORD JESUS, direct and strengthen,
and then send me where thou pleasest! I beg, most earnestly beg the
continuance of your prayers, and am, very dear, honoured Sir,

                        Your most dutiful, &c.

_My very dear Friend_,

IT hath given me concern, that I have not been able to write one letter
to _Georgia_, since my arrival at _New-York_. But it was impracticable.
Sickness, travelling, and preaching prevented me. However, I must
snatch a few minutes now. They leave me at _Boston_, where as well
as in other places, the word hath run and been glorified, and people
rather more eager to hear than ever. LORD, what am I? O that I could
sink into nothing before thee! After staying a short time, I purpose,
GOD willing, to go through _Connecticut_ to _New-York_, and so on
by land to _Georgia_. Blessed be GOD, that a Governor is at length
nominated. I wish you joy of your new honour, which I find, by this
week’s post, is conferred upon you. May the King of kings enable
you to discharge your trust, as becomes a good patriot, subject, and
christian! The LORD help us to look to the rock whence we have been
hewn. I wish I knew when the Governor intends being at _Georgia_,
I would willingly be there to pay my respects to him. But this must
be left to divine Providence. If we acknowledge GOD in all our ways,
he hath promised to direct our paths. O my dear old friend and first
fellow-traveller, my heart is engaged for your temporal and eternal
welfare. You have now, I think, a call to retire from business, and
to give up your time to the public. May the LORD of all lords direct,
assist, and bless you and yours more and more. I hope Mrs. _H――――_ is
well: I have much to say when we meet. GOD deals most bountifully with
me. Enemies are made to be at peace, and friends are every where hearty.
Remember me in the kindest manner to all with you, and continue to pray
for

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXIII.


                            _To Mr. V――――._

                                          _Boston, October 14, 1754._

_My very dear Friend_,

SURELY my coming here was of GOD. At _Rhode-Island_ I preached five
times. People convened immediately, and flocked to hear more eagerly
than ever. The same scene opens at _Boston_. Thousands waited for,
and thousands attended on the word preached. At the _Old North_, at
seven in the morning, we generally have three thousand hearers, and
many cannot come in. Convictions I hear do fasten, and many souls are
comforted. Doctor _S――――_ hath engaged me once to preach his lecture.
The polite, I hear, are taken, and opposition falls. What art thou,
O mountain? before our great _Zerubbabel_ thou shalt become a plain.
I preach at the _Old_ and the _New North_. Mr. _P――――_ and Dr. _S――――_
continue to pray for me. A Governor for _Georgia_ being nominated,
determines my way thither. O that I may always follow GOD, even a GOD
in CHRIST! This week I set out for Mr. _S――――_’s. The door opens wider
and wider. Pray tell Mr. _H――――_, that I left his horse a little lame
at _Long-Island_, with one who is called in contempt _Saint Dick_. All
hail such reproach! I could enlarge, but must away. Adieu. My hearty
love awaits your whole self, and all who are so kind as to enquire
after the chief of sinners, but for CHRIST’s sake, my very dear friend,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXIV.


                            _To Dr. S――――._

                                          _Boston, October 14, 1754._

_My very dear Doctor_,

SHALL I promise and not perform? GOD forbid.――Accept, therefore, a few
lines of grateful love. They bring you good news. At _Rhode-Island_ and
this place, souls fly to the gospel like doves to the windows. A divine
power hath hitherto accompanied the word, and opposition seems to fall
daily. Next week I purpose to go Eastward, and then I intend making as
much haste as can be back to you. A Governor, I find, is appointed for
_Georgia_, and my friend _H――――_ made Secretary. Those that honour GOD,
he will honour. I have preached in four large meeting-houses, and the
prospect of doing good is very promising. I was received with an excess
of joy. LORD, what am I? Give me humility, for thy mercy’s sake! Adieu.
Remember me to all enquiring friends, and believe me to be, my dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                      _Portsmouth (New-Hampshire), October 24, 1754._

_My very dear Sir_,

ABOUT a month ago I wrote you a few lines from the _New-Jersies_.
Since that I am advanced about three hundred miles further northward.
But what have I seen? _Dagon_ falling every where before the ark;
enemies silenced, or made to own the finger of GOD; and the friends of
JESUS triumphing in his glorious conquest. At _Boston_ a most lovely
scene hath opened. In the morning before seven o’clock, though the
meeting-houses will hold about four thousand, yet many were obliged to
go away, and I was helped in through the window. The prospect is most
promising indeed. In the country a like scene opens; I am enabled to
preach always twice, and sometimes thrice a day. Thousands flock to
hear, and JESUS manifests forth his glory. I know you will rejoice, and
join in crying Grace! grace! I am now come to the end of my _northward_
line, and in a day or two purpose to turn back, in order to preach
all the way to _Georgia_. It is about a sixteen hundred miles journey.
JESUS is able to carry me through. Into his almighty and all-gracious
hands I commend my spirit. I hope to write to you in the way. Gladly
would I embark now for _England_, but I shall leave my _American_
business but half done, if I come over now. LORD, help me! How little
can I do for thee! And the little I can do, alas! with what a mixture
of corruption and infirmities is it attended. Behold I am vile.
Increase my obligations, my very dear Sir, by continuing to pray for

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXVI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                      _Portsmouth, October 25, 1754._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR letter, as well as another from _Rhode-Island_, helped to lay me
low before him, who delights to work by the meanest instrument. Still
the LORD of all lords stoops to accompany my feeble labours with his
divine presence. At _Salem_ we were favoured with a sweet and divine
influence. _Sunday_ was a high day at _Ipswich_; twice I preached
for Mr. _R――――_, and once for Mr. _W――――_. Hundreds were without the
doors. On _Monday_ at _Newbury_ the like scene opened twice. Here Mr.
_S――――_ met me, and on _Tuesday_ morning we had a blessed season. Too
many came to meet and bring me into _Portsmouth_, where I preached
on _Tuesday_ evening, also twice the next day, and just now I have
taken my leave. The blessed Spirit vouchsafed to be with us each
time. Yesterday I preached at _York_ and _Kittery_: at both places
the Redeemer manifested forth his glory. In the evening I waited on
general _P――――_, who, with his Lady, were very glad to see me. I am
now going to _Greenland_ and _Durham_, and to-morrow shall preach at
_Exeter_. The sabbath is to be kept at _Newbury_. _Monday_ I am to
preach thrice,――at _Rowley_, _Byfield_, and _Ipswich_; _Tuesday_, at
_Cape Ann_, and _Wednesday_ night or _Thursday_ morning at _Boston_,
if the prisoner is to die, though I want another week in these parts.
Excuse great haste; I must away. Pray write a line by next ship to
_London_. Salute all friends, and continue to pray for, very dear Sir,

                      Yours in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                   _Rhode-Island, November 22, 1754._

_My very dear Friend_,

YESTERDAY as I was riding along, I felt a love for you, which only
friends experience, and was determined to write to you immediately. In
the evening my faithful _Gaius_ Mr. _S――――_ brought your kind letter,
which I now take the first opportunity of answering. But what shall
I say? What you have heard is more than true. A more effectual door I
never saw opened, than lately at _Boston_, and indeed in every place
where I have been in _New-England_; not a hundredth part can well
be told you. With great difficulty I am got to this place, where
people, as I am informed, are athirst to hear the word of GOD. I shall
therefore stay, GOD willing, till _Monday_, and then set forward to
_Connecticut_ in my way to _New-York_, which I hope to reach in about
a fortnight. O that you may see me grown in grace, and humbled under
a sense of those amazing mercies which I have received during this
expedition! It seems to me to be the most important one I was ever
employed in. Much, yea very much have I to tell you when we meet. I
wish for the season, and entreat you in the mean while not to forget
me at his throne, who alone can uphold me with his right hand. O what
a friend is JESUS! A friend that sticks closer than a brother. He is
indeed the pilgrim’s stay and staff; few choose to try him in such a
station. This be my happy lot! I write this at Mr. _C――――_’s who hath
lately buried his wife. What a changing world! Thanks be to GOD for an
unchangeable CHRIST! To his most tender and never-failing mercy, do I
most earnestly commend both you and yours, and hoping ere long to see
you, and rejoice together in our common Lord, I subscribe myself, very
dear Mr. _S――――_,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                   _Rhode-Island, November 25, 1754._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

IS it true that your father-in-law and your dear yoke-fellow are
dead? I sympathize with you from my inmost soul. At the same time as
I rejoice on their account, who are happily arrived,

                Where pain and sin and sorrow cease,
                And all is calm and joy and peace.

Surely your turn and mine will come ere long. In the mean while, may
I be doing something for my GOD! This shews you where I am at present,
going towards _Georgia_ from _Boston_, where my reception hath been
far superior to that fourteen years ago. In that and other places
in _New-England_, I have been enabled to preach near a hundred times
since the beginning of _October_, and thanks be to GOD, we scarce
had so much as one dry meeting. Not a hundredth part can be told you.
In _Philadelphia_, _New-Jersies_, and at _New-York_ also, the great
Redeemer caused his word to run and be glorified. I am now returning
through those and the other Southward provinces again, in my way to
_Georgia_, where I expect to see our new Governor. Blessed be GOD,
_Bethesda_ is in growing circumstances, and, I trust, will more and
more answer the end of its institution. I was exceedingly delighted at
_New-Jersey_ commencement. Surely that college is of GOD. The worthy
president (Mr. _Burr_) intends to correspond with you. O that I could
do it oftener: but it is impracticable. Travelling, and preaching
always twice, and frequently thrice, engrosseth almost all my time.
However, neither you nor any of my dear _Glasgow_ friends, are
forgotten by me. No, no: they are engraven upon the very tables of my
heart. O that the LORD of all lords, whose mercy endureth for ever, may
give you hearts to remember poor sinful, ill, and hell-deserving me!
Fain would I continue a pilgrim for life.

              Christ’s presence doth my pains beguile,
              And make each wilderness to smile.

I have a fourteen hundred miles ride before me; but _nil desperandum,
Christo duce, auspice Christo_. When I have seen Governor _D――――_,
I hope to write to dear Mr. _M――――_. How is my dear _Gaius_, _S――――_,
&c.? But I must not begin to mention names. Affection rises, and I
shall be too eager to see them. LORD JESUS, hasten that blessed time,
when we shall together see and enjoy thee for ever in glory! To this
comforting and never-failing JESUS, do I most heartily commit you, as
being, reverend and very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXIX.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                             _Bohemia (Maryland). December 27, 1754._

_Dear Madam_,

I HAVE just now taken leave of the northern provinces, where I have
been travelling and preaching for near these five months. I suppose in
all, I may have rode near two thousand miles, and preached about two
hundred and thirty times; but to how many thousand souls cannot well be
told. O what days of the Son of man have I seen! GOD be merciful to me
an ungrateful sinner! I am now forty years of age, and would business
permit, would gladly spend the day in retirement and deep humiliation
before that JESUS for whom I have done so little, notwithstanding
he hath done and suffered so much for me. Well! to-morrow, O blessed
JESUS, through thy divine assistance, will I begin, and travel for thee
again! LORD, is the call to _Virginia_? Who knows but an infinitely
condescending GOD may improve me there! About _February_ I hope to
reach _Georgia_, and at Spring to embark for _England_. There, dear
Madam, I expect to see you once more in this land of the dying. If not,
ere long I shall meet you in the land of the living indeed, and thank
you before men and angels, for all favours conferred on, Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXX.


                            _To Mr. O――――._

                                        _Bohemia, December 27, 1754._

_Very dear Sir_,

HOW condescending is true Friendship! And how does love, founded upon
the love of GOD, like its blessed Author, delight to stoop to its
beloved object! Your kind letter, which I received last week from
worthy Governor _B――――_, is a proof of this. An affection, a reciprocal
affection something like your own, would have constrained me to answer
it sooner, but travelling and preaching (my old excuse) have prevented
me. At length I am got into _Maryland_, and into a family, out of which,
I trust, five have been born of GOD. Gladly would I spend this whole
day in deep humiliation and prayer: for I am now forty years of age. Fy
upon me, fy upon me. Alas! how little have I done for JESUS! O that my
head was water! O that my eyes were fountains of tears! What mercies,
what infinite mercies have I received! What poor returns have I made!
Behold, I am vile! Am not I treating you like a friend, even like a
_Boston_ friend, my dear Sir? Yes, I am; and since you commanded me,
I will. Your letter bespeaks you to be worthy of that sacred name, and
to be acquainted with that which few, very few know any thing about; I
mean the delicacies of true disinterested friendship. This is a secret
that none but beloved disciples are let into. May you always remain
in the number of these, and when you are leaning on that bosom, where
all that is lovely centers, may you have a heart to remember one who
is called to travel, whilst you are acting in another sphere for GOD!
Blessed be his name, heaven is at the end of the journey. Happy Mrs.
_L――――_! she hath had a speedy translation. May my latter end be like
hers! How ought such events to teach us to converse when together, that
if we should be called before the next intended meeting, we might have
no trifling conversation to reflect upon. To-morrow, GOD willing, I
move again. Ere long my last remove will come; a remove into endless
bliss, where with you and all the redeemed of the LORD, I trust you
will see, very dear Sir,

                Your most obliged, affectionate friend,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXXI.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                        _Virginia, January 17, 1755._

I AM just now on the borders of _North-Carolina_, and after preaching
to-morrow in a neighbouring church, I purpose to take my leave of
_Virginia_. Had I not been detained so long at the northward, what
a wide and effectual door might have been opened.――Here, as well
as elsewhere, rich and poor flock to hear the everlasting gospel.
Many have come forty or fifty miles, and a spirit of conviction and
consolation seemed to go through all the assemblies. One Colonel
_R――――_, a person of distinction, opened one church for me, invited me
to his house, and introduced me himself to the reading desk. As I was
riding in his chariot, he informed me of his intention to see _Boston_
next Summer. If my friends would be so good as to mention my name, and
shew him some respect when he comes amongst you, it would add to my
obligations. Blessed be GOD, I see a vast alteration for the better.
O for more time, and if possible for more souls and bodies! LORD JESUS,
twenty times ten thousand are too few for thee, and yet (O amazing love)
thou art willing to accept of only two mites! These, I trust, you, my
very dear Sir, have put into his sacred treasury. O that the trifling
thing called _honour_, may never, so much as for a single moment, draw
you from your GOD! I hope Colonel _P――――_ stands to his colours. Then
I live, if my dear friends stand fast in the LORD. My most cordial
respects and tender love await them all. I doubt not of your improving
Mrs. _L――――_’s sudden dissolution; another call to be always ready.
That this may be the happy lot of you and yours, is and shall be the
earnest prayer of, very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXII.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                        _Virginia, January 17, 1755._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

THOUGH at this distance of time and place, yet I do not forget our
solemn and mournful parting. Blessed be GOD, there is a time coming,
when these cutting trials will be over. I long, I long for it, and yet
when fresh doors of usefulness are opening, I am content to stay below.
This I trust is the case at present in _Virginia_. The prospect is
promising indeed. People have flocked from all parts to hear the word,
and arrows of conviction have fled, and I believe stuck fast. Seed sown
several years ago, hath sprung up and brought forth fruit. Doth not the
LORD of the harvest by this say, “Go forward.” Do, my dear Sir, help me
by your prayers; I want to have my tardy pace quickened. I am now forty
years old. Surely it is high time to awake out of sleep. I doubt not
but this will find you and yours all alive for JESUS. Being straitened
for time, I must beg you to remember me in the most tender manner to
all dear, very dear friends as they come in your way, and accept the
same for your whole self, from, reverend and very dear Sir,

           Your most affectionate, obliged friend, brother,
                    and servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXIII.


                            _To Mr. F――――._

                                        _Virginia, January 17, 1755._

_My dear Mr. F――――_,

I HOPE that this will find you safely arrived at _Philadelphia_,
from your northward expedition, and ready to come further southwards.
This leaves me in my last _Virginia_ stage, near the borders of
_North-Carolina_. People as I came along have been very willing to
attend on my feeble labours, and I hope that some real good hath been
done. If this be effected, it matters little how the labourer himself
may be sometimes fatigued.

                His presence doth my pains beguile,
                And makes the wilderness to smile.

Lovely delusion this! Living, dying, and after death I hope to be
possessed of it. I have seen your _Epitaph_. Believe on JESUS, and get
a feeling possession of GOD in your heart, and you cannot possibly be
disappointed of your expected second edition, finely corrected, and
infinitely amended. _Verbum sapienti sat est._ I could say more, but
time is short. Glad shall I be to wait on you and Mr. _H――――_ at the
Orphan-house. I send you both my cordial respects, and praying that you
may have what good Colonel _G――――r_ once wished me, “A thriving soul in
a healthy body,” I subscribe myself, my dear Sir,

         Your affectionate, obliged friend and ready servant,

_My very dear Jonathan_,

THAT ever-loving and ever-lovely Redeemer that owned my feeble labours
in the northward, still continues to bless and succeed me in my journey
southward. I have not been here a week, and have had the comfort of
seeing many impressed under the word every day. Two churches have
been opened, and a third (_Richmond_) I am to preach in to-morrow.
Prejudices I find do subside, and some of the rich and great begin
to think favourably of the work of GOD. Several of the lower class
have been with me acknowledging what the LORD of all Lords did for
them, when I was here before. O that I may be humbly thankful, and
improve every smile to quicken my tardy pace, and make me all alive for
JESUS! About this day month, I hope to reach _Georgia_; from thence, I
intend writing to you again. But be where I will, dear _Boston_ is much
upon my heart. This may serve as a proof that you and yours are not
forgotten. Indeed and indeed I often think of, and pray for you from my
inmost soul. Blessed be GOD, that we can meet at the throne of grace!
JESUS sits thereon, even JESUS our advocate, our GOD, and our All. You
must add to my obligations, by continuing to pray, that I may begin to
love and serve him in earnest, and thus you will appear a _Jonathan_
indeed, to,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                       _Charles-Town, March 3, 1755._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

THROUGH divine goodness we arrived here last _Wednesday_ afternoon, on
_Thursday_ Mr. _E――――_ was solemnly ordained, and on _Friday_ _Andrew
H――――n_ and his wife, and _R――――_, came in a schooner from _Port-Royal_.
I believe they will settle here.――The trials I have met with on various
accounts, have brought my old vomitings upon me, and my soul hath been
pierced with many sorrows.――But I believe, (LORD help my unbelief!)
that all is intended for my good.――Amidst every thing, I am comforted
at the present situation of _Bethesda_.――I hope you will love and walk
in love, and the children also grow in years and grace.――I purpose
sending all the things by Mr. _R――――n_, who comes shortly by water.
Then I purpose writing to dear Mr. _Dixon_ and others, and hope by
that time to be determined what course I shall steer. O that it may be
heaven-wards, go where I will! This I know will be your prayer, and the
prayer of the rest of my dear family in my behalf.――I pray for you all
night and day.――I would have you write to Mr. _H――――t_ by the bearer,
who is an experimental Baptist preacher from the northward.――O that he
may say something, that may do my dear family some good.――Mr. _Z――――y_
will be with you in about three weeks. The LORD be with you all. Hoping
to write again ere long, and wishing you all much of his presence, that
is better than life, I subscribe myself, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

                  Your most assured friend, brother,
                     and servant in CHRIST JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To the Same._

                                      _Charles-Town, March 17, 1755._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

HAD I wings like a dove, how often would I have fled to _Bethesda_
since my departure from it. I could almost say, that the few last
hours I was there, were superior in satisfaction to any hours I ever
enjoyed. But I must go about my heavenly Father’s business.――For this,
I am a poor but willing pilgrim, and give up all that is near and
dear to me on this side eternity.――This week I expect to embark in
the _Friendship_, Captain _Ball_; but am glad of the letters from
_Bethesda_ before I go.――They made me weep, and caused me to throw
myself prostrate before a prayer-hearing and promise-keeping GOD.――He
will give strength, he will give power. Fear not; you are now I believe
where the LORD would have you be, and all will be well.――I repose
the utmost confidence in you, under GOD, and verily believe that I
shall not be disappointed of my hope.――I should have been glad if the
apples had been sent in the boat; they would have been useful in the
voyage.――But JESUS can stay me with better apples.――May you and all my
dear family have plenty of these! I imagine it will not be long before
I return from _England_. Now _Bethesda_ would be pleasant. GOD make
it more and more so to you and to all. I can only recommend you in the
most endearing manner to the ever-blessed JESUS, and my unworthy vile
self to your continual prayers, as being, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ I hope that one of the players is snatched as a brand out of
the burning. Grace! grace!

                                              _London, May 10, 1755._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

THE love which I owe and bear to you for the LORD JESUS CHRIST’s sake,
constrains me to send you a few lines immediately upon my arrival at my
native country.――I arrived at _New-haven_ in _Sussex_ the 8th instant,
after a six weeks passage. Hither the cloud seemed to move, though
I must own that I left _America_ with regret.――Never was the door
opened wider in those parts for preaching the everlasting gospel, than
now.――Perhaps this may shorten my stay at home, but future things
belong to JESUS. It is not in man to direct his steps.――Prepare us, O
LORD, for whatever thou hast prepared for us! I hear, you have met with
changes since my departure.――What have we to do to expect any thing
else? Dear Mr. _M――――n_!――Whither is he gone? Where JESUS reigns, and
where, through rich and sovereign grace, even ill and hell deserving
I, hope ere long to be.――Hasten, glorious _Emmanuel_, that wished-for
time!――If your dear yoke-fellow is also gone, she I trust is happy
too.――_Sequar, etsi non passibus æquis._――You will write soon, and send
me some news about the upper world.――This is scarce worth a thought.――I
hope my dear host and hostess, Mr. _S――――_, Mrs. _M――――_, and all
friends are well.――I can only send them and you my hearty love, and beg
the continuance of your prayers for, very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                              _London, May 13, 1755._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

SINCE I put my letter into the office on _Saturday_ night, I have
heard that your Ladyship was gone to _Ashby_, and therefore make bold
to trouble your Ladyship with a few more lines. They leave me safely
arrived at my desired port, and endeavouring to begin to do something
for him, who hath loaded me with his benefits, and still continues
to smile upon my feeble labours. Glad am I to hear, that so many
have lately been stirred up to preach a crucified Saviour. Surely
that scripture must be fulfilled, “and many of the priests also were
obedient to the word.” The work is of GOD, and therefore must prosper.
Blessed be his great name, for continuing to hold your Ladyship
as a star in his right-hand. May you shine more and more till the
perfect day! I find your Ladyship still delights to do good. The late
benefaction for _Bethesda_ came very opportunely; GOD will provide!
That institution begins to rise. But I cannot descend to particulars
now; ere long I hope to wait on your Ladyship at _Bristol_. My first
circuit is to be in the west. Hoping to be favoured soon with a line to
acquaint me of your Ladyship’s welfare, and earnestly praying that your
Ladyship and honoured relations may be filled with all the fulness of
GOD, I beg leave to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

                         Your Ladyship’s, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXIX.


                      _To the Marquis of L――――._

                                              _London, May 14, 1755._

BEING but lately arrived in my native country, I take the first
opportunity of returning your Lordship thanks for your great zeal
in promoting the welfare of _New Jersey_ college. Surely it is the
purest seminary that I have known. Your Lordship’s name is precious in
_America_, and children yet unborn will be bound to bless GOD for what
you have done. I think, if the degree of Doctor of divinity could be
procured for Mr. _A―――― B――――_, their present worthy president, it
would still make an addition to the honours of the college. He is a
most excellent man; your Lordship will not be offended at my making the
motion. Blessed be GOD, in various places abroad, the gospel runs and
is glorified. In _Virginia_ a wide and effectual door is opened. The
_Indian_ mission can never I think come upon a proper establishment,
till some lands are purchased, and the _Indians_ brought to live
together upon them. The plan that was laid, I mentioned to Mr. _D――――_
some months ago, and ere now, I suppose your Lordship hath seen it.
O for that happy time, when the kingdoms of the earth shall become
the kingdoms of the LORD and of his CHRIST! Blessed _Emmanuel_, may
thy temple be built in troublesome times! But I forget myself. Your
Lordship will excuse my freedom. I am writing to one who delights
to serve the Redeemer’s interest. That your Lordship may have the
continued honour of confessing him upon earth, and be confessed by him
after death in the kingdom of heaven, is and shall be the prayer of, my
Lord,

              Your Lordship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MLXXX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                              _London, May 27, 1755._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

IT hath given me great concern, that I have not been able till now,
to acknowledge your Ladyship’s most kind letter. I could almost say,
excess of business at my first coming over hath prevented me; but to
make the most of it, I do but little, and that little in so bad a way,
that if it was not for the compleat and all-sufficient righteousness of
the everlasting, ever-lovely JESUS, I could not lift up my guilty head.
And yet what a blessed week have we had! Surely, sinners have come
like a cloud, and fled like doves to the windows. In about a fortnight,
I hope to take the field in _Gloucestershire_, and shall endeavour
to make all possible dispatch in the west, in order to wait on your
Ladyship in my northern visit. Help me, thou friend of sinners, to be
nothing, and to say nothing, that thou mayest say and do every thing,
and be my all in all!――What a happiness is it to be absorbed and
swallowed up in GOD? To have no schemes, no views, but to promote the
common salvation. This be my happy lot! Your Ladyship will still add to
my innumerable obligations, by praying for me. How shall I express my
gratitude?――Tears trickle from my eyes, whilst I am thinking of your
Ladyship’s condescending to patronize such a dead dog as I am. But it
is because I belong to JESUS. He will, he will reward your Ladyship
openly. Ever-honoured Madam excuse me. Tears flow too fast for me to
write on. I must go and speak to GOD for you and yours, as being,
ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXI.


                         _To Governor B――――._

                                              _London, June 6, 1755._

_Much-honoured Sir_,

WHILST I remain myself where you are called to sojourn, in this dying
world, I trust your Excellency will never be forgotten by unworthy
me. You see, honoured Sir, where a poor but willing pilgrim is tossed
now. Just this day month did I arrive in this metropolis, where,
glory, glory be to the great head of the church! The word hath still
free course. The poor despised Methodists are as lively as ever,
and in several churches the gospel is now preached with power. Many
in _Oxford_ are awakened to the knowledge of the truth, and I have
heard almost every week of some fresh minister or another, that seems
determined to know nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified. This,
I am persuaded, is the best news I can send to your Excellency. This,
must necessarily rejoice your heart, which I know pants after nothing
more, than the enlargement of the Mediator’s kingdom. Ere long, your
utmost thirsting shall be satisfied, you shall see JESUS; you shall
see him as he is: _O Gloriam quantam et qualem_! GOD give me patience
to wait till my appointed change comes! But would it not be a shame to
go to heaven without scarce beginning to do something for the blessed
Redeemer? He that searches the heart and trieth the reins, knows full
well, how often I cry out, “my leanness, my leanness!” GOD be praised,
next week I hope to go on my country range. I hope that your Excellency
will have a heart given you to pray for me, whilst life lasts, and
after death I doubt not but the glorious _Emmanuel_ will reward you
before men and angels, for all your works of faith, and labours of love,
which you have done for the church in general, and particularly for all
favours conferred on, honoured, much-honoured Sir,

             Your Excellency’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                              _London, June 7, 1755._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

JUST now I was informed that the bag is to be taken away this afternoon;
hurried therefore as I am, you must have a few lines.――And why? Because
I love and honour you for JESUS CHRIST’s sake. Will it not rejoice
you to hear that his glorious gospel gets ground apace. Several of the
clergy, both in town and country, have been lately stirred up to preach
CHRIST crucified, in the demonstration of the spirit and with power.
This excites the enmity of the old serpent, which discovers itself in
various shapes. The greatest venom is spit out against Mr. _R――――n_,
who having been reputed a great scholar, is now looked upon and treated
as a great fool; because made wise himself, and earnestly desirous
that others also should be made wise to eternal salvation. Methinks
I hear you say, O happy folly! May this blessed leaven diffuse and
spread itself through the whole nation! The prospect is promising.
Many students at _Oxford_ are earnestly learning CHRIST. Dear Mr.
_H――――y_ hath learnt and preached him some years; his loving and truly
catholic heart chearfully complied with the motion about your future
correspondence. As for myself, I can only say “that less than the
least of all,” must be my motto still. I labour but feebly, and yet,
O amazing condescension! JESUS owns and succeeds such feeble labours.
People still continue to flock to the gospel, like doves to the windows.
Next week I begin to take my country range. Be so good, my dear Sir,
to add to my obligations, by continuing to remember a poor but willing
pilgrim, and to salute all my dear friends as they come in your way.
I hope, Mr. _A――――_ (to whom I send cordial respects) goes hand in
hand with you, striving together for the faith and the practice of the
gospel.――Glorious strife this! I do not forget the books I promised
to look out for.――I have spoken to Mr. _H――――_, but he says they are
very difficult to be procured. I would write to the Chief Justice,
but suppose he is at the northward. Will you be pleased to accept of
my _Lisbon_ letters, to be disposed of as you think proper? My little
communion-book is not yet come out. GOD be praised, that there is
a time coming when we shall need books and ordinances no more, but
shall be admitted into an uninterrupted communion and fellowship with
the blessed Trinity for evermore. The LORD ripen us for that blissful
state! I must bid you farewel. Be pleased to excuse the length of this,
as being occasioned by the love unfeigned which is due to you from,
reverend and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MLXXXIII.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                             _London, June 12, 1755._

_Dear Nat._,

I THINK every thing is now procured that was in the memorandums. I
would have sent the children’s cloaths, &c. but they could not be got
ready; you will therefore have them by another opportunity. I am glad
to hear by your last, that the children go on well in their learning.
Let this encourage you to go on, and who knows, but by and by they may
learn CHRIST? Such power belongs only unto GOD. I am quite satisfied
in your present employ, and doubt not (if you are cloathed with
humility, as I trust you will be) but GOD will bless and delight to
honour you. To have our own mother’s children angry with and despise
us, _if sanctified_, is a good preservative against self-love, and
self-complacency: it puts us more upon the watch, and drives us nearer
to GOD. This be your happy lot! As for your affair with Mr. _C――――_,
I can only say, you have my leave to act as you think best.――Shew thy
will, O GOD, and give power to perform it! To _A―――― W――――_ and his
wife, I have allowed twenty pounds _per annum_, till they have a place,
or get into business. GOD knows, I can little afford it; but I can
as yet trust on him, who feedeth the ravens, and hath promised to
supply all my wants. O that the LORD of all Lords may keep you all at
_Bethesda_ of one heart and one mind, and give you to send me such news,
as may gladden my frequently burdened (though I hope disinterested)
mind; and cause me to go on with more chearfulness and joy! Thanks
be to GOD, my feeble labours on this side the water, are owned and
succeeded. People seem to be as lively as ever. I hope the time will
come, when _Bethesda_ also shall blossom like a rose. We wait for thy
salvation O LORD; make no long tarrying our LORD and our GOD! My dear
_Nat._ farewel. Feed CHRIST’s lambs, and he will feast thy soul.――Look
upon his work as its own wages, and he will richly repay thee for all
thy care. I charge you, and all, to continue wrestling in prayer for me,
as being, dear _Nat._

       Your assured friend and ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXIV.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                             _London, June 13, 1755._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I WROTE to you amidst a great throng of business, a few days ago,
by a _Carolina_ ship. I am now retired to Mr. _C――――_’s, in order to
send you a few lines more. Matters about Mr. ―――― and his wife, have
happened as might be expected; it is my lot to be a pelican. But all
will be well at last; I know who will stand on my side. Thanks be to
GOD for JESUS CHRIST! He upholds me, and daily succeeds my feeble, but
I trust honest labours, and that to me is all in all. I hope you will
write often. What your brother hath written, I know not. I believe you
are where GOD would have you to be, and I pray him night and day to
make you more and more a mother in _Israel_. Ere this comes to hand,
I hope you will have received the things from the northward. However
it fares with me at home, fain would I care for my dear friends and
family abroad. GOD will provide! This is my comfort. Much depends on
your success in the silk, but more on my family’s increasing in the
knowledge of JESUS. O that this may be their happy case! O that the
LORD of all Lords may feed you in that wilderness! He is good to us
here. We have golden seasons at the tabernacle, and several ministers
preach CHRIST in the churches. This makes my call abroad still more
clear. Though I have not yet entered upon my country range, methinks
I could set out for _America_ to-morrow. What is time, relations,
and even the enjoyment of GOD’s people, compared with the unmixed,
uninterrupted joys of an happy eternity! Here I could enlarge, and on
this dwell, but must away. Ere long I hope to write to you again, and
in the mean while beg leave to subscribe myself, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

            Your most assured friend, and willing servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXV.


                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                            _Bristol, June 27, 1755._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

EVER since I received your last kind letter, I have been so perpetually
engaged in preaching, travelling, and a multiplicity of other business,
that I have not been able to answer it till now. In _London_ the word
runs and is glorified, and every day almost we have heard of fresh
ministers of our national church being called out, and spirited up to
preach the truth as it is in JESUS. This is my first excursion: I came
through _Gloucestershire_, where the fields were white, ready unto
harvest. Thrice last Lord’s-day, many many thousands attended on the
word preached, and I believe a divine power accompanied it. That is all
in all.――People in this place hear as for eternity. Next week I shall
travel further westward; but whether I can see _Scotland_ this summer,
the Redeemer only knows. But whether absent or present, you, my dear
Sir, and my other _Scotch_ friends, have my poor prayers night and day,
that your souls and bodies may prosper and be in health. O that GOD
may hear you for unworthy me! I long, I long to do something for JESUS.
Glad would I be to serve the church of CHRIST any way. If you remember,
I hinted to you something about getting a Doctor’s degree for President
_Burr_; since that I wrote to the Marquis of _L――――n_. His Lordship
writes thus: “The university of _Edinburgh_ desire of me to obtain some
account of Mr. _Aaron Burr_’s literature, or performances: this I hope
you will do, and a diploma will be immediately transmitted.” By this
post, I shall write what I know of the President, but I would have you
and Mr. _E――――_ write also, immediately to the Marquis. Surely he is
the most worthy, ingenious, diligent, and truly christian President
of his age, now in the world. He hath published something lately to
animate our people against the common enemy. I have it at _London_,
and hope you have it with you. If so, be pleased to transmit it to the
Marquis. I shall mention it, and so do you, to his Lordship. Adieu, my
very dear Sir, adieu. I must away. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ bless
and prosper you and yours, and all the dear followers of the Lamb!
I cannot forget you, and hope never shall, whilst I have strength to
subscribe, what indeed I am, my very dear friend,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXVI.


                      _To the Marquis of L――――._

                                            _Bristol, June 27, 1755._

_My Lord_,

HOW shall I express my gratitude to your Lordship, for condescending to
answer my poor letter, and so readily concurring with the motion made
in it, for a degree being procured for my worthy friend? The great Head
of the church will bless and reward your Lordship for it. Never was
there a man in the world, that could be more safely recommended as a
scholar, and a truly christian minister of the gospel, and a laborious
prudent President of a college, than Mr. _Aaron Burr_.――He was educated
at _Yale College_ in _Connecticut, New England_; and for his pregnant
abilities, and many years well approved piety, was unanimously chosen
to succeed the Reverend Mr. _D――――_ in the care of _New-Jersey_ college.
It would have delighted your Lordship, to have seen how gloriously
he filled the chair last year, at the _New-Jersey_ commencement. His
_Latin_ oration was beautifully elegant, and was delivered with an
unaffected, yet striking energy and pathos. As a preacher, disputant,
and head of a college, he shines in _North America_; and the present
prosperity of the _New Jersey_ college, is, under GOD, greatly owing
to his learning, piety, and conduct. The students revere and love
him. Your Lordship might have testimonials enough from good Governor
_B――――r_, Mr. _Jonathan Edwards_, _cum multis aliis_. And I believe,
they would all concur in saying, “that of his age (now upwards of forty)
there is not a more accomplished deserving President in the world.”
As for any thing of his in print, that can be referred to, I cannot
say, unless it be a little pamphlet lately published, in which he hath
animated the people against the common enemy, and discovered a close
attachment to the interest of our rightful sovereign King _George_. May
the King of kings long preserve his important and precious life! This
piece of Mr. _Burr_’s I have at _London_, and hope it is in _Scotland_.
I just now wrote to Mr. _G――――_ of _Glasgow_, who, together with
Mr. _J―――― E――――_, I suppose will write to your Lordship concerning
Mr. _Burr_. I wish the diploma may be transmitted against the next
commencement. It will endear your Lordship more and more to the good
people of _America_. May the LORD of all lords vouchsafe your Lordship
a good degree in the kingdom of heaven! O for the lowest place there!
It will be abundantly too high for such an unworthy wretch as I am:
but his name and nature is Love. He still vouchsafes to employ me, and
still continues to countenance my feeble labours. At _London_ we have
enjoyed golden seasons, and in the country the fields are white ready
unto harvest. O that we may be helped to bear the heat and burden of
every day! That your Lordship may live long to do much for CHRIST, and
be at last gathered like a ripe shock of corn into his heavenly garner,
is the earnest prayer of, my Lord,

              Your Lordship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MLXXXVII.


                        _To Mr. Thomas J――――._

                                            _Bristol, June 27, 1755._

_My dear Thomas_,

YOUR treatment of me at _Honslow_, put me in mind of _Joseph_’s steward,
who put his brothers money, unknown to them, into their sacks mouth.
Well! JESUS takes notice of all help vouchsafed his servants, and will
not forget those who assist them in their pilgrimage for his great
name’s sake. You and yours then will not be forgotten:――and GOD forbid
that I should cease praying for you both. The Searcher of hearts knows
that I love you both in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST; and my heart’s
desire night and day is, that you may be rich, yea very rich towards
GOD. Such are durable riches. Every thing else is less than vanity
itself. Thanks be to GOD for such an unspeakable gift! This supports
me in my pilgrimage, and makes me go on my way rejoicing. Thousands
and thousands flocked in _Gloucestershire_; and here the congregations
fall little short of those at _London_. The blessed Redeemer shews us
his stately steps. O that we may feel his renovating, sin-subduing,
heart-refining power more and more! So shall we approve ourselves to
be his disciples, who hath said, that those “whom the Son of man makes
free, are free indeed.” Adieu. The LORD be with you and yours. My love
to Mr. _W――――_, Mr. _K――――_, &c. I forget none of you. I pray the LORD
of all lords to keep you unspotted from the world, and entreat you not
to forget

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MLXXXVIII.

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YESTERDAY about noon, after being worn down with travelling, and
preaching twice and thrice a day in _Gloucestershire_, at _Bath_
and _Bristol_, a gracious and never-failing Providence brought me to
town, where I had the pleasure of receiving two kind, very kind and
undeserved letters from your Ladyship’s hand. Had I the least leisure
or strength, I should have written a letter of condolence to your
Ladyship from _Bristol_. There I heard of the death of good Lady _Ann_,
and was glad to find that Miss _W――――_ bore the news of it with so much
composure. Alas! how many have your Ladyship lived to see go before
you! An earnest this, I hope, that you are to live to a good old age,
and be more and more a mother in _Israel_. A short, but sweet character.
GOD knows how long I am to drag this crazy load, my body, along.
Blessed be his holy name, I have not one attachment to this inferior
earth. I am sick of myself, sick of the world, sick of the church, and
am panting daily after the full enjoyment of my GOD. _John C――――_ is
now added to the happy number of those who are called to see him as he
is. I do not envy, but I want to follow after him. Give me patience,
holy JESUS, to wait till my appointed time shall come. In the mean
while, if it be thy holy will, improve me to promote, in some small
degree, thy glory and the good of souls! Thanks be to his adorable
majesty, the fields at _Bristol_ and _Kingswood_ were whiter, and more
ready to harvest than for many years last past. Was the new Tabernacle
at _Bristol_ as large as that in _London_, it would be filled. Thrice
last _Sunday_, and twice the _Sunday_ before, I preached in the fields
to many, many thousands. The youngest of the Miss _W――――_’s, and little
Miss _H――――_ attended twice, and again by six on the _Sunday_ morning.
At _Bath_ we had good seasons; good Lady _G――――_, Mrs. _B――――_, _G――――_,
Miss _H――――_, &c. were very hearty, and GOD was with us of a truth. Mr.
_T――――_’s wife, of _Cornwall_, is dead, and my brother hath been very
ill of a fever; but they tell me (and he doth himself) that the blessed
JESUS hath visited his soul. If so, his journey hither will be a happy
one. LORD, help me to pray, and not to faint! O for an humble, thankful
heart! I am now looking up for direction what course to steer next. I
suppose it will be northward. I wish your Ladyship’s plan may do; but I
fear the parts about your Ladyship are too cold. O how unworthy of such
a guest! Well, honoured, ever-honoured Madam, in the _New-Jerusalem_,
your Ladyship will have company enough. There the Redeemer shall hold
up before the mighty and the noble, and let them see what almighty,
rich, and sovereign grace could do. Be pleased, my good Lady, to excuse
the length of this. Gratitude always gives motion to my pen, when
writing to your Ladyship. I am ashamed, that I have not so much as a
pepper-corn to offer as an humble tribute. JESUS, the ever-loving, the
altogether lovely JESUS must pay you all. I must away to preach the
everlasting gospel. O how unworthy of such a divine employ! Pardon,
honoured Madam, this poor, and too prolix scribble, and assure yourself,
that neither your Ladyship nor family are ever forgotten by

                Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, unworthy,
                 but ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MLXXXIX.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――n._

                                             _London, July 25, 1755._

_My dear Friend_,

I RECEIVED your kind letter, and have since heard of your removal
from _Indian_ land. I cannot help commending you for it, since I know
various places, where you might do as much good in a week, as in those
parts for years. Poor _Indian_ land! I fear thou hast had thy call!
May JESUS secure the remaining few, and be their refuge from every
impending storm! O my dear friend, you and I shall find more and more,
that we must be made perfect by sufferings. If we do not meet them
in our younger days, we shall certainly have them in the decline of
life. Trials, at such a season, are like the finishing strokes of
the Limner’s pencil. They serve, in the hands of the holy Spirit, to
compleat the new creature, and make it fit for heaven. Happy they who
can say, “He knoweth the way that I take:” when they are tried, they
shall come forth like gold. GOD only knows what a trying season lies
before us. It is to be feared, that we are upon the eve of a bloody
war. O that the war between _Michael_ and the _Dragon_ may go on! The
prospect is promising. Several ministers preach CHRIST boldly; and as
for my own poor feeble labours, the blessed JESUS vouchsafes to crown
them with success. So many paths lie open, that I can scarce tell
which to take first. Through frequent preaching and travelling, and a
multiplicity of business, I have been so weakened, that I am obliged
to retire for a little relaxation, and to get leisure to write you
these few lines. May they find you and yours rejoicing in tribulation,
and increasing with all the increase of GOD! I commend you, and all
enquiring friends, to the care of Him, who never faileth those who
trust in him, and entreat the continuance of your prayers in behalf of,
my dear friend,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MXC.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                             _London, July 25, 1755._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I WRITE this from Mr. _C――――_’s, whither I have retired for a little
relaxation, and to get leisure to write a few letters. Your brother is
just gone from me, and would send you his hearty love if he knew of my
writing. _T――――_ is gone to _Plymouth_, and Miss _L――――_ is sick of a
fever (though I hope not dangerously) at _Lewisham_. Mrs. _W――――_, one
of the conference, I buried last _Tuesday_; and am longing for that
happy time when this frail tabernacle shall be also laid in the silent
grave. It hath tottered lately more than ever, and yet the Redeemer
vouchsafes so to comfort me within, that methinks I am not yet to die,
but live and declare the works of the LORD. O that I may begin to begin
to do something for my GOD! I am afraid we are at the eve of a war:
but fear not. _Bethesda_ especially, I believe, will be hid under the
shadow of the Redeemer’s wings. Whilst I have persons there (as I think
is the case now) that act with a single eye, I am persuaded it will be
like the _burning bush_. Pray remember me to all in the kindest manner.
I hope to write when the childrens cloaths are ready. We have blessed
seasons at Tabernacle. I have met with some outward as well as inward
trials; but this is my comfort, “The LORD knoweth the way that I
take. When I am tried I shall come forth like gold.” O that faith and
patience may have their perfect work in this sin-sick soul! Desire dear
_Nat_, Mr. _Dix_, &c. not to be uneasy, because I do not write now;
it is impracticable. Night and day you are all upon my heart, and I
long to hear how you go on. My blessing attends you all, even you and
the children. Surely, was I retired from public work, feeding CHRIST’s
lambs should be my constant employ. But alas! I must be in the front of
the battle. LORD JESUS, magnify thy strength in my weakness, or I shall
deny thee and desert my post! Pray hard all of you, I intreat you, for
me, and let me know all your wants. I will labour night and day to have
them supplied, and will pray the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls to
pay you blessed wages. I know you will be content with such a paymaster.
I commend you all to his never-failing mercy, as being, dear Mrs.
_C――――_,

               Your most sincere and cordial friend and
                  willing servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Norwich, August 9, 1755._

_Elect Lady_,

HOW glad was I some time ago to receive a letter from your Ladyship!
How glad am I now to sit down to answer it, and thereby renew a
correspondence, which to me was always profitable and delightful! Shall
I wish your Ladyship joy? Of what? Not barely of your additional estate
and honour, but of your having an opportunity, with your noble Lord,
of moving in a superior orb, and letting your light shine more before
men. The LORD of all lords only knows, how I love and honour you both;
though I have not written, yet I have not ceased praying for you and
yours these many years. Your honoured family on both sides, must always
be dear to me. What _Bethels_, what gates of heaven have we been in
together, whilst engaged in social prayer, and reading and opening
the lively oracles of GOD! Had I wings, gladly would I fly to see your
Ladyship’s dear little growing family: but GOD only knows, whether
I shall be able to reach _Scotland_ this year. I am now at _Norwich_,
where there hath undoubtedly been a glorious work of GOD. Twice a day,
both gentle and simple flock to hear the word, and I think it comes
with power. LORD, what am I? In _London_, I think, our people are as
lively as ever; in _Bristol_ they are the same; and as for _America_,
words cannot express the glorious scenes that opened in various parts,
especially at _Boston_ in _New-England_. The tide ran full as high as
ever your Ladyship knew it at _Edinburgh_, or in any part of _Scotland_.
This I know is the best news I can send to your Ladyship; for what news,
comparatively speaking, is worth hearing, except that which concerns
the kingdom of GOD? What beauties worth admiring, but the beauties of
JESUS CHRIST? What riches worth possessing, but the substantial and
durable riches of the divine life? What honour worth acquiring, but
that honour which cometh from GOD? May these be the beauties, these
the riches, these the honours of you and your noble Lord! I assure your
Ladyship that my heart springs when I think of him, or write his name.
I truly loved the father, I as truly and most affectionately respect
and love the son. GOD almighty bless you both, and give you grace to
keep yourselves unspotted from the world! Glad shall I be to see his
Lordship in town. In the mean while, I hope his Lordship, and the
honourable family where you are, will accept not of bare compliments,
but unfeigned and most cordial acknowledgments and respects. May the
great physician of souls vouchsafe to give you all thriving souls
in healthy bodies! I am glad to hear good Lady _D――――_ is well. My
obligations to her, and all your honoured family, are very great. Be
pleased to accept this poor pepper-corn, which, except my poor prayers,
is all the acknowledgment that can be made by, my good Lady,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Norwich, August 9, 1755._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

TILL _Tuesday_ evening, I knew no more of coming to _Norwich_ than the
child unborn. Had I been well enough, and my private business permitted,
I should have been some miles in my way towards ♦_Donnington_ park.
This I told Mr. _H――――ly_, and acquainted him with every step; he
should have written himself, and not retailed our conversation. As I
expect to be in town some time next week, I choose to defer writing
more till we have a personal interview. My time is too precious to be
employed in hearkening to, or vindicating of myself against, the false
and invidious insinuations of narrow and low-life informers. Never was
I more satisfied of my call to any place, than of my present call to
_Norwich_. The Redeemer knows the way that I take. I came hither purely
for his glory, without the least design to make a party for myself, or
to please or displease any other party whatsoever. In this way, and in
this spirit, through his divine assistance, I hope to go on. Blessed be
his name, I trust my feeble labours have not been in vain. Sin, I hope,
hath been prevented, errors detected, sinners convicted, saints edified,
and my own soul sweetly refreshed. But I must add no more. That JESUS
may give us all a right judgment in all things, and keep all parties
whatsoever from giving a wrong touch to the ark, is and shall be the
constant prayer of, reverend and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _London, August 20, 1755._

_Honoured and very dear Sir_,

AS long as GOD is pleased to hold my soul in life, and I hear that
you also are in the land of the living, I shall always think it my
bounden duty to thank, and pray for you. Surely you have been to me,
honoured Sir, a father and a friend. Be pleased to accept repeated
acknowledgments for all favours conferred on me at college, and the
great care you took to prepare me for the ministry of the church.
Alas! I am ashamed of my unfruitfulness, and wonder that the blessed
Redeemer continues to improve me at all. But his name and nature is
Love. He hath once more brought me safe over the mighty waters, and
hath vouchsafed to own my poor feeble labours in yonder new world. The
Orphan-house, blessed be his name, is on a good footing, and I trust
will prove a nursery for church and state, when my head is laid in the
silent grave. I am waiting daily for my discharge, and long to be at
home. Be pleased to add to my innumerable obligations, by continuing to
pray for me. I retain my old name, being the chief of sinners, and less
than the least of all saints, but, honoured and very dear Sir,

              Your most obliged, dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friends_,

I RECEIVED both your kind letters, and likewise one from Mr. _W――――_,
and last night a long one from Mr. _C――――_; but alas! I have no time
for controversy. To their own Master they must both either stand or
fall. All I can say in your present circumstances, is, “that you had
best make a trial, and let matters for a while stand as they are.” I
have sent letters, if possible, to prevent the spreading, at least the
_publishing_ any further tales. In the mean while, my dear friends, do
you strengthen yourselves in the LORD your GOD. The cause is his; you
honestly, I believe, embarked in it for his great name’s sake, and he
will help you out of all. When I see Mr. _R――――r_, I shall speak to him
again. But to-morrow I must away to the northward. Follow me, I entreat
you, with your prayers, and assure yourselves, that you and yours, and
the dear people of _Norwich_, will not be forgotten by me. If ever the
Redeemer, in his good providence, should bring me thither again, I can
then converse with Mr. _W――――_ and _C――――_ face to face;――but I beg to
be excused from writing, when I think by so doing I can do no service.
The LORD cloathe us all with humility, and give us all true simplicity
and godly sincerity! Then we need fear nothing. Blessed be his name,
we have golden seasons here. Blessed be his name, if any good was done
by my poor feeble labours in your city. To Him, who delights to shew
himself strong in behalf of those who are of an upright heart, be all
the glory. If I know any thing of myself, I want to supplant none, but
to strengthen the hands of all that preach and live CHRIST JESUS. In
his great name, and with repeated thanks for all favours, I subscribe
myself, my very dear friends,

                      Yours most affectionately,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Miss_,

A FEW days past, as I was going into the Tabernacle to read letters,
yours came to hand; immediately I read it among the rest, and you and
my other dear _New-England_ friends had the prayers of thousands. But
how did I wish to be transported to _America_! How did I long to stir
up all against the common enemy, and to be made instrumental in doing
my dear country some little service! But surely GOD sent me over at
this juncture, and therefore I hope to be resigned. Already, blessed
be his name, he hath vouchsafed to own my feeble labours in _London_,
_Gloucestershire_, _Bristol_, _Bath_, and _Norwich_. I have been at the
last place very lately, and notwithstanding offences have come, there
hath been a glorious work begun, and is now carrying on. The Polite
and Great seem to hear with much attention, and I scarce ever preached
a week together with greater freedom. Praise the LORD, O my soul! I am
now going my northern circuit, and perhaps may take a trip to _Ireland_.
O what a pity is it, that we have but one body and one soul for JESUS
CHRIST! I write this from dear Mr. _H――――_’s, who sends kind love to
all his dear _New-England_ friends, and earnestly begs the continuance
of their prayers. He is now writing another volume upon sanctification:
that, you say, dear Miss, is what you want. That is what the
ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS longs to give. Out of his fulness we are
all to receive even grace for grace. But how slow are we to believe!
LORD, I believe, help my unbelief! must be my language still. I thank
your honoured father for the kind present of the sermons, charter, &c.
I see you are resolved to increase my obligations, till they amount
to a prodigious sum. My blessed Master must pay you all. O that I may
be remembered before him; night and day, in public and in private!
Dear _New-England_, dear _Boston_ lies upon my heart; surely the LORD
will not give it over into the enemies hand. He hath too many praying
ministers and praying people there, for such a dreadful catastrophe.
Immediately upon hearing of your late defeat, I preached from those
words, “When the enemy comes in like a flood, then the spirit of the
LORD lifts up a standard against him.” This we shall find true in a
temporal and spiritual sense.

            Blest is faith that trusts Christ’s power,
            Blest are saints that wait his hour.

I could enlarge, but must away. My heart is full for dear _New-England_,
and I must go to GOD and vent it. I can only send you and your honoured
parents, and all your religious associates, and all enquiring friends,
ten thousand thanks for all favours, and beg them never to cease
praying for, dear Miss,

               Their and your assured and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

_Dear Madam_,

THOUGH Providence prevented my seeing you again, yet you have been
much upon my heart. As a proof of it, be pleased to accept of these few
hasty lines. I find you are once more called to give up your honoured
husband for his country’s good. That GOD whom you serve, will richly
reward you for such a sacrifice, and be better to you than seven
husbands. I long, I long to hear that he is returned victorious. He
is gone upon a good cause, and under the conduct of the best general,
even the Captain of our salvation. To him I am praying night and day
for the temporal and spiritual welfare of dear, never to be forgotten
_New-England_. Courage, dear Madam, courage:――a few more partings, a
few more changes, a few more heart-breakings, heart-purifying trials,
and we shall be safe landed. That you and yours, dear Madam, may have
a triumphant entrance administered to you into the heavenly kingdom, is
and shall be the hearty prayer of, dear Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s obliged and ready servant, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MXCVII


                            _TO Mr. V――――._

                                    _Weston-Favell, August 30, 1755._

_My dear Friend_,

I WROTE you a letter just before I left _Charles-Town_, which I find
you have not received. The things sent proved bad, but I have a GOD
to go to, who can and will supply all my wants according to the riches
of his grace in CHRIST JESUS. I am sorry that your people continue
yet as sheep having no shepherd. What I said about Mr. _B――――_, was by
commission from himself, I wish Mr. _D――――_ may see his way clear. But
who will come to be torn in pieces by two contending parties?

                Giver of concord, prince of peace,
                Meek lamb-like Son of GOD,
                Bid these unchristian jarrings cease,
                O quench them with thy blood!

Amidst all this, what a mercy is it, my dear friend, that JESUS shews
you more of your heart. O thank him a thousand and a thousand times,
for pointing out to you the sin that doth most easily beset you. Surely
it is a too great love of money. Of this your friends every where take
notice; and this, in many cases, makes you act an unfriendly part.
If GOD should suffer our enemies to prevail, you will wish you had
laid up more treasure in heaven. Blessed be GOD, mine is out of the
reach of men or devils. Strange! that five per cent. from man, should
be preferred to a hundred-fold from CHRIST! A word to the wise is
sufficient. I should not have said this, lest there should be the
appearance of self-interest, had you not given me the hint. But I hope
you know, (however, I am sure that GOD knows) that I want to deny,
not enrich myself. But enough of this. I am now looking out for more
news from dear _America_. May the late defeat be sanctified; and then
I doubt not but we shall be more than conquerors through the love of
CHRIST. I often wish myself abroad; but assuredly Providence called
me home.――My poor feeble labours are still blessed both in town and
country, and many dear ministers of JESUS are coming out. It would
delight you to be at Tabernacle. We are often in the suburbs of heaven.
I write this from dear Mr. _H――――y_’s, in my way to _Yorkshire_,
and perhaps _Ireland_, I told him what you wrote about _Theron_ and
_Aspasio_, and he begs your prayers. O _America_, how near dost thou
lie upon my heart! GOD preserve it from popish tyranny and arbitrary
power! I can write no more. Adieu, my dear Mr. _V――――_. Continue to
write to me, and live and give for JESUS, who hath given you this
world, and that which is to come. Was you here, methinks we should
weep together. O redeeming love! How can we think of it, and at the
same time not be ambitious of opportunities to spend and be spent for
JESUS. _Non magna loquimur, non magna scribimus, sed vivimus_, is the
christian’s motto. Mr. _D――――_ can _English_ it. I send to him, and
all enquiring friends, my cordial respects. I saw his daughter well
at _Braintree_ a little while ago. There, as well as elsewhere, we had
blessed seasons. I know you will join in crying Grace! grace! with, my
dear _Gaius_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                    _Northampton, September 1, 1755._

AND did my dear Mr. _S――――_ direct a letter and not send me one line at
a venture? Well, I thank him even for the direction, as well as for all
other unmerited favours. O that it was in my power to shew my gratitude
in a substantial manner! This is my comfort, GOD is a prayer-hearing,
promise-keeping GOD. He will not fail those, who have confessed him or
his ministers before men.――It may be, before men they shall be rewarded.
Certain it is, they shall be confessed by JESUS CHRIST in the presence
of men and angels in the kingdom of heaven. This, ere long, will
be your happiness. Methinks I long for the day; but am ashamed I do
no more for JESUS, who yet continues to employ me. Every where the
fields are white ready unto harvest. At _London_, _Bristol_, _Bath_,
in _Gloucestershire_, at _Norwich_, _Bury_, _Braintree_, and yesterday
twice here, we had blessed seasons. I am now going into _Yorkshire_,
and it may be to _Ireland_. If there should be a bloody war, GOD only
knows when I shall see my dear _New-England_. Thither I find a strong
attraction. O for good news from the northern forces! I suppose death
must come first before life.――This is always the method of Providence.
LORD, help us to pray and not faint! Happy they who have got a JESUS
to fly to: he is our refuge from every storm. Your whole self and all
enquiring friends do I most earnestly commend to his never-failing
mercy, as being, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                    _Northampton, September 1, 1755._

_My dear Sir_,

ACCORDING to my promise, before I embarked for _England_, I sent you
the copy of my oath, from _Charles-Town_; which, I fear, is not come
to hand, because not mentioned in either of your letters, which I had
the pleasure of receiving a few days ago. In my way northward, I take
the first opportunity of thanking you for both, and at the same time
heartily thank the Captain of our salvation, for giving you grace to
stand to your colours, and persist in your spiritual warfare. Perhaps,
ere this reaches _Boston_, you may be called out in the service of your
country. May your head, and the heads of all engaged, be covered in
every day of battle; and may our troops be made in the end more than
conquerors through the love of GOD! This is what we are assured of in
our spiritual combat.――JESUS, who is truth itself, hath told us, that
nothing shall pluck us out of his almighty hands. Though faint then,
let us still pursue. Through the Redeemer strengthening me, I am yet
continuing my feeble labours, which, I trust, are not in vain in the
LORD. Fain would I be with you; but Providence seems to have cast my
lot at present here. Well, my dear Sir, there is a place, at which,
though absent from, we may be present with each other; I mean the
throne of grace. There, GOD willing, I will often meet you. I know
you will accept the challenge, and GOD himself will say, _Amen_. Glad
should I be to hear from you frequently. O for good news from dear
_New-England_! Blessed be GOD for what you send me concerning Mrs.
_P――――_. May root and branch be spared for the Mediator’s glory! To
his tender, never-failing mercy, do I most humbly commend you, and all
other enquiring friends, as being, my dear Sir,

            Your most affectionate friend and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MC.


                           _To Mrs. M――――._

                                         _Liverpool, Sept. 12, 1755._

_Dear Madam_,

ERE this can reach you, I hope the days of your mourning will be
ended. By your last to Mr. _W――――_ I find your harp was hanging upon
the willows, your chariot wheels taken off, and your poor soul driving
heavily. Add to all this,――Satan was besetting you on every side,
and so daring as to say, “Where is now thy GOD?”――This is his common
artifice; thus he attacked the great High-priest and blessed apostle
of our profession, “If thou be the Son of GOD, &c.” But if you love not
JESUS, whence this pain of absence? Why so often crying out,

                  For to my soul it’s hell to be
                  But for one moment void of thee?

This is not the language of a hypocrite. No: it is the native, genuine
cry of a new and heaven-born soul. Woman, therefore, why weepest thou?
Thy LORD hath drank of this bitter cup before thee.

                He knows what this temptation means,
                For he hath felt the same.

Look then to Him, dear Madam, who upon the cross cried out in the
bitterness of his soul, “My GOD, my GOD, why hast thou forsaken me?”
The Redeemer is now only giving you blessings in disguise, and teaching
you instructive lessons by the thorns and briars of the wilderness. Now
is the time for you to prove the strength of JESUS yours, and to learn
to live upon a GOD that changeth not. Be pleased to excuse this freedom.
At Mr. _W――――d_’s desire I take it. Your advice to him, amidst all your
gloom, bespeaks your concern for the ark of GOD; I wish he may take
it. But I love not to interfere in other people’s plans, any further
than I can contribute a mite towards promoting the common salvation.
This principle made me incline to see _Ireland_, but I believe the
season is too far gone. The Redeemer’s time is best. O that all may
have grace given them to wait his leisure! Then will affairs have
a more comfortable aspect, and many wrong touches of the ark be
happily prevented. Blessed be GOD, in many places the word runs and is
glorified. O that I could begin to begin to do something for JESUS! I
wish that Mr. _C――――_ may be raised to work for him once more. And yet,
methinks it is cruel to wish him to stay longer out of heaven. GOD give
me patience to wait till my wished-for change shall come! My cordial
respects await all that love CHRIST JESUS in sincerity.――Be pleased to
accept the same for your whole self, from, dear Madam,

             Your sympathizing friend, and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Newcastle, September 24, 1755._

_My very dear Sir_,

AT length I can sit down, and send you (what I know you dearly
love) some good news concerning the kingdom of JESUS CHRIST. O
infinite condescension! He hath vouchsafed to own and bless my feeble
labours all the way. At _Northampton_ we had blessed seasons; at
Lady _H――――n_’s, the LORD of all Lords was with us of a truth; at
_Liverpool_ I trust some fallow ground was broken up; at _Bolton_ the
cup of many ran over; at _Manchester_ people heard most gladly; and at
_Leeds_ and _Bradford_, what many felt, I believe, is unutterable. In
my way hither, I hope a smart gentleman was touched at _York_, and
several I find were awakened when I was at this place last. LORD, what
am I?

                If thou excuse, then work thy will,
                By so unfit an instrument;
                It will at once thy goodness shew,
                And prove thy power omnipotent.

What GOD does further, you may hear by and by. Perhaps I am at the end
of my northern circuit, and I fear I am too impatient to get at the end
of my christian race. I long, I long to see JESUS. Well, he that comes,
will come and will not tarry. His reward is with him; then, but not
till then, shall you and yours be fully recompensed, for strengthening
my poor feeble hands in the LORD. He only knows how feeble. Surely this
is grace indeed, to employ such a wretch as I am. Help me to adore it.
Continue to pray for me, and thereby add to the obligations already
conferred on, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Newcastle, September 24, 1755._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I KNOW not how long it is since I left your Ladyship; but this I know,
a sense of the satisfaction I felt when at ♦_Donnington_, still lies
upon my heart. Surely, was I not called out to public work, waiting
upon and administring to your Ladyship in holy offices would be my
choice and highest privilege. But JESUS calls, and therefore I travel
to do or suffer thy will, O GOD! The only new ground that hath been
broken up, I think is _Liverpool_; there the prospect is promising. I
preached in a great square on the Lord’s day, and the alarm I hear went
through the town. At _Bolton_ the cup of GOD’s people ran over; and at
_Manchester_ we had large auditories and blessed seasons. At _Leeds_ we
felt what is unutterable, and at _Bradford_, I believe, last _Sunday_
the congregation consisted of at least ten thousand. But O how hath my
pleasure been alloyed at _Leeds_! I rejoiced there with trembling; for
unknown to me, they had almost finished a large house in order to form
a separate congregation. If this scheme succeeds, an awful separation
I fear will take place amongst the societies. I have written to Mr.
_W――――_, and have done all I could to prevent it. O this self-love,
this self-will! It is the devil of devils. LORD JESUS, may thy blessed
spirit purge it out of all our hearts! But O how must the divine
Paraclete sit as a refiner’s fire upon the heart, in order to bring
this about! Few choose such fiery purgations, and therefore so few make
the progress that might justly be expected of them in the divine life.
Make me, O GOD, willing to be made, willing to be, to do, or suffer
what thou pleasest, and then――――what then?――this foolish fluttering
heart will sweetly be moulded into the divine image.――This I write from
_Newcastle_, where the people twice a day hear the gospel gladly. At
_York_ I hope a fine gentleman was touched, and several I find were
awakened there, and here also, at my last visit. What to do now, I know
not. Calls on all sides are very loud, and it is too late to go either
to _Ireland_ or _Scotland_. O my GOD!――Winter is at hand, and in the
summer how little hath been done for thee! I cannot bear to live at
this poor dying rate. My good and ever-honoured Lady, add; for CHRIST’s
sake add to my already innumerable obligations, by praying for a poor
unfruitful and ungrateful dwarf. I am sick of my vileness, and yet just
comes in a letter acquainting me, that my preaching hath been blessed
to many this morning. Good GOD, what is this? Grace! Grace! I am lost,
I am lost.

                    Take me Uriel, take me hence,
                    And bear my soul to GOD.

Your Ladyship sees I am running into my old fault. I cannot well help
it, when writing to your Ladyship. May the choicest of GOD’s mercies
rest on you and yours! I hope my poor but sincere respects will find
acceptance with Lady _S――――_’s, Master _H――――_, &c. I must away to pray
for your Ladyship and them, and therefore hasten to subscribe myself,
ever-honoured Madam,

                  Your Ladyship’s most ready servant,

_My dear Friend_,

WHO would but wish to be in heaven, where we shall enjoy the communion
of saints without interruption? Whilst here, how long is it before
we can answer each other’s letters? With difficulty I now sit down
to answer your last; for these seven or eight days past, I have been
deeply engaged in travelling, and preaching thrice a day. JESUS CHRIST
hath made it pleasant to my soul, and comfortably supported my weak
body. It being so late in the year, I cannot proceed further northward.
However I must write, if it be only to let you know, that my dear
_Scotch_ friends are continually upon my heart, and that I most
earnestly beg the continuance of their prayers. I am a dwarf,――I am
a dwarf,――and that is enough to excite their pity. Alas! alas! Autumn
is come, winter is drawing on, and (O my GOD) how little have I done
for thee in the summer. The concern I feel upon this account almost
prevents my writing. Adieu, I must retire.――My tender love to Mrs.
_B――――_, and all that are so kind as to inquire after me. Exhort them
to love, and live near to the ever-loving JESUS, and for his great
name’s sake, never to forget, my dear friend,

                Their and your affectionate friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_My very dear Friend_,

LAST night, a never-failing GOD brought me from the north of _England_,
where I have been enabled to preach twice and thrice a day, to many,
many thousands for these two months last past. And yet I cannot
die.――Nay they tell me, “I grow fat.” O that I may grow in grace,
especially in humility! Then would the LORD delight to honour me.
Vile as I am, this he continues to do. Never did I see the word more
blessed, or so many thousands run after it with greater greediness.
Next to inviting them to CHRIST, I have always taken care to exhort
them to pray for King _George_, and our dear friends in _America_.
I trust, that thousands are now engaged this way, and whatever dark
providences may intervene, I hope to hear they have been more than
conquerors.――“Pray continue to write,” I often tell my friend. I often
think of him who sent me the glass, before the friend of sinners. GOD
almighty bless you and yours, and all enquiring dear souls, with all
spiritual and temporal blessings! I see some are marrying, and others
giving in marriage. May the LORD JESUS sanctify every change, till we
all come to sit down at the marriage feast of the supper of the Lamb!
There I hope ere long to meet you. Fly, fly, Time: hasten, hasten,
O wished-for Eternity! Adieu: my tender love to all. I wish dear Mr.
_T――――_ a good help-mate, but above all, I wish him much success in
espousing poor sinners to the ever adorable JESUS. Once more farewel.

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

ON _Thursday_ evening, a never-failing Providence brought me in safety
from my northern circuit, and this morning I find a letter of a distant
date from you, which before I look over my other letters, I sit down to
answer. And what shall I say? Blessed be GOD, I have good news to send
you from the north country; never did I see the word of GOD have freer
course, or congregations more numerous or attentive. I was strengthened
to preach generally twice or thrice a day, and thanks be to my gracious
Master, my poor carcase held it out. Next to JESUS, my King and
country were upon my heart. I acted as at _Stroud_, and other parts of
_Gloucestershire_, and I hope I shall always think it my bounden duty,
next to inviting sinners to the blessed JESUS, to exhort my hearers
to exert themselves against the first approaches of popish tyranny and
arbitrary power. O that we may be enabled to watch and pray against all
the opposition of _Antichrist_ in our hearts; for after all, there lies
the most dangerous man of sin; there is the temple in which he sits,
exalting himself above all that is called GOD. And what shall, what can
destroy him? Nothing but the breath of the Redeemer’s mouth, and the
brightness of his appearing, by his blessed spirit in our souls. O
for more of this baptismal fire! GOD give you, and the dear Alderman,
to pray earnestly for me, that I may begin at length to be a little
alive to my GOD. O winter! winter! how near art thou drawing, and how
little have I done for Jesus in the summer! Perhaps before _Christmas_
I may see you again. Future things belong to JESUS. To his tender
never-failing mercy do I most heartily commit you, and the dear
Alderman, all your relations, and all enquiring friends, and once more
beg that you will not forget to pray for, my dear Mr. _B――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCVI.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

WHAT shall I say? Indeed and indeed, it hath given me great concern,
that I could not perform my promise to return to _Donnington-park_ so
soon as I expected.――But had I done so, I must have failed preaching at
least to above fifty thousand souls, who at different places ran most
greedily many miles after the everlasting gospel. This I thought your
Ladyship would by no means approve of, and therefore acquiesced. On
_Thursday_ evening, with no small regret I came to town, after having
preached about a hundred times, and travelled about eight hundred miles
in the country. Blessed be GOD, my feeble carcase was strengthened to
hold out, though for more than ten days together, I preached thrice a
day.――O that I could preach three hundred times! all would be little
enough, (alas, alas, infinitely too little) to testify my feeble love
to the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. I hope that your Ladyship, and
the other elect Ladies, will enjoy much of his blessed spirit, in your
present sweet retreat. After about a week’s stay here, I hope to move
westward. O winter, winter! haste and fly, that I may again set out,
and begin to spring for my GOD! I know I shall have your Ladyship’s
prayers, and I am sure your Ladyship and family and friends have
mine. Yesterday I waited upon the Countess _D――――_, and on _Thursday_,
GOD willing, I am to dine with her Ladyship. Blessed be GOD, all
was well. O for growth in grace! O for the total destruction of self
and selfishness! Alas, what inward purgations and martyrdoms must be
undergone! LORD JESUS, we are the clay, and thou art the potter; stamp
thine image in what way thou pleasest! I know your Ladyship will say,
Amen. I trust an “Even so, LORD JESUS, come quickly,” is sincerely
added by, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

ARE you yet called out in defence of your country? The measures taken
by your honourable and loyal council and assembly, I hope will be
blessed to prevent a stir so near to _Boston_. I am glad to hear, that
the Ladies are employed in making the soldiers cloaths; I trust my
female friends are some of the most active. Surely, the cause is the
cause of GOD, and if done out of love to JESUS, this labour of love
shall not go unrewarded. GOD make male and female good soldiers of
JESUS CHRIST! Nothing like fighting under his banner; he is a refuge
from every storm. I can only add, that I most earnestly commend you and
yours, and the whole circle of my never to be forgotten friends, to his
never-failing mercy, and intreat you to accept these few hasty lines,
as a token of love and respect unfeigned, from, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCVIII.

                                          _London, November 8, 1755._

_Very dear Sir_,

I HEAR you have been sitting night and day in council. May JESUS, the
wonderful counsellor, preside in your assembly, and influence you to
pursue such measures, as may be blessed to the humbling a persidious
enemy, and making the dear _New Englanders_ more than conquerors
through the love of GOD! All we can do on this side the water, is to
pray. This I trust thousands are doing every day.――I seldom preach,
without mentioning dear _New England_. O for more good news from that
part of yonder new world! O that this time of outward danger, may be
sanctified to the exciting of greater zeal against our inward spiritual
enemies! For after all, the man of sin in our own hearts, is the
greatest foe the real christian hath to fear. May JESUS destroy him
both within and without, by the breath of his mouth, and the brightness
of his appearing! Blessed be GOD, the prospect is promising here! In
the north of _England_, the word runs and is glorified more than ever,
and in _London_ people flock like doves to the windows:――and yet I
feel a strong attraction for _America_. Pray be so kind, very dear Sir,
to send me some account now and then, how matters stand.――Perhaps it
may be of some service. I could enlarge, but must drop a line or two
more to some more friends, and therefore can only send my most cordial
salutations to yourself, and whole houshold, and begging a continued
interest in your prayers, subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

              Your most obliged, affectionate friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, November 10, 1755._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind and condescending letter, found me just returned
from _Chatham_, and led me (as your Ladyship’s letters always do) to
a throne of grace. I immediately threw myself prostrate before GOD,
and earnestly prayed, in my poor feeble manner, that grace, mercy, and
peace might be multiplied upon your Ladyship, and your happy family.
The Court, in the best sense of the word, is now removed to _Clifton_.
For there only is the real court kept, where JESUS reigns, and where
he has erected a spiritual kingdom in the heart. All besides this, is
only tinsel and glitter. Here alone is real and abiding happiness to
be found. O for further searches into the heighths and depths of GOD?
O for further leadings into the chambers of that selfish, sensual,
and devilish imagery, that yet lie latent in my partly renewed heart.
This self-love, what a _Proteus_! This self-will, what an Hydra? This
remaining body of sin and death, what an antichrist! what a scarlet
whore! what a hell! what a red dragon! what a cursed monster is it!
How hard, how slow he dies! O what gratitude do I owe to the bruiser of
this serpent’s head! O for a heart gladly to embrace every cross, every
trying dispensation, that may have a tendency to poison, or starve,
or nip the buddings of the old, and cherish, promote, or cause to
bloom and blossom the graces and tempers of the new man in my soul!
Ordinances, providences, doctrines, (I am more and more convinced)
are of no service to believers, than as they are attended with this
mortifying and life-giving power. Happy family, that have this one
thing in view! Happy retirement, that is improved to this blessed
purpose! Happy, therefore, good Lady _H――――n_, and the other elect
Ladies, who are determined thus to go on hand in hand to heaven! All
hail, ye new-born, heaven-born souls! ye know, by happy experience,
that JESUS is an inward as well as an outward saviour, and that he came
indeed and indeed to redeem us from this present evil world. Was even
annihilation to follow at death, who would but have this redemption
whilst they live? But, glory, glory be to GOD, it is only the dawning
of an eternal day, the beginning of a life that is ere long to be
absorbed and swallowed up in never-ceasing, uninterrupted fruition of
the ever-blessed triune Deity. O the depth, the height of this love
of GOD! It passeth human and angelic knowledge. My paper only permits
me to add, (GOD knows it is with gratitude and sincerity) that I am,
ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

TO be three weeks without sending you a line, seems a long while to me.
What if we should meet ere long in an endless and happy eternity? For
near ten days past I have preached in pain, occasioned by a sore throat,
which I find now is the beginning of an inflammatory quinsey. Silence
and warmth, the doctor tells me, under GOD, may cure me, but heaven
(if I had my will) is my choice, especially if I can speak no longer
on earth for my GOD. However, painful and expensive as, in a spiritual
sense, the medicine of silence is, I have promised to be very obedient,
and therefore I have not preached this morning. If I grow better,
(as the world terms it) I hope to see you in about a fortnight, if
otherwise, GOD willing, you shall hear from me again. Blessed be JESUS,
I am ready; I know that my Redeemer liveth. O that all who were lately
swallowed up in _Portugal_, had known it! Then an earthquake would
only be a rumbling chariot to carry the soul to GOD. Poor _Lisbon!_
how soon are all thy riches and superstitious pageantry swallowed up!
What a shock must the news give to a full exchange! Who would but lay
up treasure in heaven? Thanks be to GOD, for teaching you, my very
dear Sir, this heavenly art! May you and yours improve in it every day
and hour. This is my comfort, all my goods are gone before me. O the
pleasure of having nothing, and yet possessing all things in JESUS!
This be my happy lot! I beg a continued interest in your prayers, and
trust that living and dying you will always be remembered by, my very
dear friend,

            Your most affectionate friend and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXI.


                  _To the Reverend Mr. H―――― D――――._

                                             _Bristol, Dec. 6, 1755._

_My dear Friend and Brother,_

ONE would think, that Providence did in a more immediate manner
interpose to prevent our meeting. I saw your last to Mr. _M――――n_, and
intended to have answered it for him, but it hath pleased a gracious
and sovereign GOD to silence me for a few days, by a sore throat, which
was like to have terminated in an inflammatory quinsey. This gave me
hopes of putting into port; but it seems I am yet to put out to sea
again. O that my stammering tongue may be loosed, and that I may begin
to begin to speak in earnest for my GOD! Every thing, both from within
and without, calls upon us to cry aloud and spare not. Whatever becomes
of ill and hell-deserving me, may the ever-loving and ever-lovely JESUS
cause your bow to abide in strength! I trust many arrows have stuck
fast in the North of _England_; and in the West, I trust, the sword of
the LORD hath not returned empty. On _Monday_ se’nnight, GOD willing,
I purpose going to _Gloucester_, and hope to be in _London_ soon. Our
meeting, therefore, must necessarily be put off till Spring. In the
meanwhile, I should be glad to see and converse with Mr. _J――――_,
of whom I have heard a good report. I am sorry there is no greater
connection between _England_ and _Wales_. The harvest is great, and
the disinterested labourers are few. This is my comfort, the LORD of
the harvest can and will, in his own time and way, thrust out more
labourers into the harvest. That he may own and bless you, and all in
your connection, more and more, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear
friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                         _London, December 31, 1755._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind and condescending letter should not have lain
so long by me, had not bodily weakness, and my _Christmas_ labours,
prevented my writing. Indeed and indeed my good Lady, it hath been
a joyful mournful season to my inward man. For exclusive of a pretty
sharp outward trial, _Saturday_ last being my birth-day, my soul was
deeply exercised from morning till evening, in thinking how much in
one-and-forty years I have sinned against, and how little I have done
for an infinitely good and ever-blessed GOD. This impression yet lies
deep upon my heart, and therefore, through divine assistance, I purpose
to end the old year in preaching on those words, “I abhor myself, and
repent in dust and ashes.” O that all things belonging to the old man,
may die in me, and all things belonging to the new man live and grow
in me! But alas, this is a work of time. Every day and every hour must
we be passing from death to life. Mortification and vivification make
up the whole of the divine work in the new-born soul. Come, LORD JESUS,
come quickly; have compassion on this barren fig-tree, and if it is
to be spared another year, so dig and dung round it, that it may bring
forth much fruit unto GOD! But shall I conceal the goodness of my
long-suffering Master? No: I dare not;――for in spite of my unworthiness,
he still continues to smile upon my poor ministrations, and gives me
to see his stately steps in the great congregations. A noble chapel
is now opened in _Long-acre_, where I am to read prayers and preach
twice a week. Hundreds went away last night, who could not come in; but
those that could, I trust, met with JESUS. Mr. _C――――_ and I have met
twice, and hope for a third interview very soon. LORD JESUS, make me
a peace-maker! I am obliged to Mrs. _W――――_ and the other Ladies for
their kind remembrance of an unworthy worm. I return it, by earnestly
praying, that they and your Ladyship may be filled with all the
fulness of GOD. I can rise no higher, and therefore, with all possible
acknowledgments for all unmerited favours, I must hasten to subscribe
myself, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                 very ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXIII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _London, January 1, 1756._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR not answering my two last sooner, gave me pain; sorrows are
lessened, and joys become greater by being communicated. It is so with
an earthly friend, much more so with the friend of sinners.

                Our sorrows and our tears we pour,
                Into the bosom of our GOD.

He bottles them all up, and will not suffer one of them to fall to
the ground unregarded. I hope that these trials, which, like _Job_’s
messengers, come one upon the back of another, by being sanctified,
will make your soul as a watered garden. You know who hath said, “They
that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.” O blessed religion, that shews
us the holy art of gaining by our losses, and rising by our falls!
Was it in my power, this letter should enclose something that would
stop every temporal gap; but I am not rich at present. Poor, yet
endeavouring to make many rich, I would have my motto still! Thanks
be to GOD, at our lowest estate we can draw on the bank of heaven. A
believer never hath a bill protested there. “My GOD (says the Apostle
_Paul_) shall supply all your need according to his riches in CHRIST
JESUS.” Away, and endorse it afresh, and send it directly away post on
the wings of prayer. Never fear any trial that sends you to your knees;
You must then needs go forward whether you know it or not. I would
enlarge, but weakness prevents. I have been in the furnace; I hope it
is intended to prepare me for fresh success. The awakening at _London_
seems to be quite new. Adieu, adieu. I am called away.

                            Ever yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXIV.

                                          _London, January 22, 1756._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

ENCLOSED you have some extracts, which perhaps may afford you comfort,
and I trust will excite you to pray for one, who is indeed less than
the least of all saints. Ever since I came from the North, it hath
pleased a sovereign Lord to visit me with a violent cold and sore
throat, which threatened an inflammatory quinsey. Such a thing, I hoped,
would have soon carried me, where this cold heart should for ever be
inflamed with seraphic love. But alas! I fear this wish’d-for time
is not at hand. One physician prescribed a _perpetual blister_, but I
have found _perpetual preaching_ to be a better remedy. When this grand
catholicon fails, it is over with me. You will pray, that (if I must
put out to sea again) it may be to take some fresh prizes for my GOD.
Every day brings us fresh news of newly awakened souls. Both at this
and the other end of the town, (where I now preach at a chapel twice
a week) there is a glorious stirring amongst the dry bones. My heart
is pained for dear _America_; but I trust the LORD will fight their
battles, and make them more than conquerors. Happy they who have fled
to JESUS: he is a strong and sure refuge from every storm. I hope he
hath appeared for his cause at _Glasgow_. May that dear people never
be left without many teaching priests! I send my kind host and hostess,
and all enquiring friends, most cordial respects, and beg you to accept
the same from, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common Lord,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, January 29, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship will see by the inclosed, how dangerous it is to give
me liberty. I would not grow upon it, and yet I cannot discharge
my conscience, unless I lay particular distressing applications
before your Ladyship. I know the person mentioned in Mr. _G――――_’s
letter, and believe he belongs to the little flock of JESUS: the best
recommendation that can be laid before your Ladyship. I doubt not but
what your Ladyship hath done in behalf of the prisoner, will have good
effect: I do not know how soon I may be called before my superiors
myself. The sons of _Tubal_ and _Cain_ continue to serenade me at
_Long-Acre_ chapel. They have been called before a justice; and
yesterday the Bishop of _B――――_ sent for them, and enquired where I
lived. My house is pretty public, and the Bishop of souls shall answer
for me:――he does. One, who subscribes to hire men to make the noise,
hath been pricked to the heart, and can have no rest till he speaks
with me. Thus JESUS gets himself the victory.――――One of the inclosed
extracts comes from a person, that a few weeks ago was a confirmed
deist: now, I trust, he is a little child. The Redeemer speaks, and it
is done; he commands, and new creatures instantaneously arise before
him. Your Ladyship enjoined me to be particular; I could be more so,
but must send a few lines to the elect Ladies. That they may find both
them and your Ladyship filled with all the fulness of GOD, is the
earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                 very ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXVI.

                                                   _January 30 1756._

_Honoured Sir_,

GRATITUDE constrains me to send you a few lines of thanks for the
care and zeal you have expressed in suppressing the late disorders at
_Long-Acre_ chapel. A better acknowledgment will, I trust, await you
at his bar, by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice, and who
hath instituted magistracy to be a terror to evil doers, and a praise
to them that do well. I hear that some unhappy man hath incurred the
penalty inflicted by our salutary laws. As peace, not revenge, is the
thing aimed at, I should rejoice if this could be procured without
the delinquents suffering any further punishment. Perhaps what hath
been done already, may be sufficient to deter others from any further
illegal proceedings, and that will be satisfaction enough, honoured Sir,
to

                   Your much obliged humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXVII.


                       _To the Bishop of B――――._

                                _Tabernacle-House, February 2, 1756._

_My Lord_,

A FEW weeks ago, several serious persons chosen to be a committee
for one Mr. _B――――_, applied to me in the name of JESUS CHRIST, and a
multitude of souls desirous of hearing the gospel, to preach at a place
commonly called _Long-Acre_ chapel. At the same time they acquainted me,
“That the place was licensed; that Mr. _B――――_ either had taken, or was
to take it for a certain term of years, and had preached in it for a
considerable time, as a protestant Dissenting minister: notwithstanding,
(they added) I might use the Liturgy if I thought proper, so that I
would but come and preach once or twice a week.” Looking upon this
as a providential call, from him, who in the days of his flesh taught
all that were willing to hear, _on a mount_, _in a ship_, or _by the
sea-side_, and who after his ascension, commanded us by his Apostle,
to be “instant in season and out of season,” I readily complied,
and humbly hope that my feeble, though I trust sincere labours, have
not been altogether in vain in the LORD. This being the case, your
Lordship will necessarily suppose, that I was somewhat surprized at the
prohibition I received from your Lordship this evening. For I looked
upon the place as a particular person’s property, and being, as I was
informed, not only unconsecrated, but also licensed according to law,
I thought I might innocently preach the love of a crucified Redeemer,
and for his great name’s sake, loyalty to the best of princes our dread
sovereign King _George_, without giving any just offence to _Jew_ or
_Gentile_, much less to any bishop or overseer of the church of GOD. As
I have therefore given notice of preaching to-morrow evening, and every
_Tuesday_ and _Thursday_ whilst I am in town, I hope your Lordship
will not look upon it as _contumacy_, or done out of contempt, if I
persist in prosecuting my design, till I am more particularly apprized
wherein I have erred. Controversy, my Lord, is what I abhor, and as
raising popular clamours, and ecclesiastical dissentions must be quite
unseasonable, especially at this juncture, when _France_ and _Rome_
and hell ought to be the common butt of our resentment, I hope your
Lordship will be so good as to inform yourself and me more particularly
about this matter; and upon due conviction, as I have no design but to
do good to precious souls, I promise to submit. But if your Lordship
should judge it best to decline this method, and I should be called
to answer for my conduct, either before a spiritual court, or from
the press, I trust the irregularity I am charged with, will appear
justifiable to every true lover of _English_ liberty, and what is _all_
to me, will be approved of at the awful and impartial tribunal of the
great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, in obedience to whom I beg leave to
subscribe myself, my Lord,

             Your Lordship’s most dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXVIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                _Tabernacle-House, February 9, 1756._

_Reverend Sir_,

ON our late fast day, a collection was made at the Tabernacle where
I preach, eighty pounds of which I have deposited in the hands of
Mr. _A――――_, in _Fleet-street_, for the use of the poor persecuted
_French_ protestants. That our great and compassionate High-priest may
accept it as done to himself, and bless you and the honourable society
established for promoting so laudable a charity, is the hearty prayer
of, reverend Sir,

               Your unworthy brother and fellow-labourer
                   in the cause of our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXIX.


                       _To the Bishop of B――――._

                               _Tabernacle-House, February 16, 1756._

_My Lord_,

I THIS evening received your Lordship’s kind letter, and though it is
late, and nature calls for rest, yet in the fear of him to whom all
hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid,
I desire now to sit down and give your Lordship an explicit answer.
GOD, even that GOD by whom I am to be judged, can witness, that with
a disinterested view to promote his glory, and the welfare of precious
and immortal souls, I entered into holy orders, according to the form
of ordination of the church of _England_; and, as thousands can testify,
for near these twenty years last past, I have conscientiously defended
her homilies and articles, and upon all occasions spoken well of her
liturgy. Either of these, together with her discipline, I am so far
from renouncing, much less from throwing aside all regard to, that I
earnestly pray for the due restoration of the one, and daily lament
the wanton departure of too, too many from the other. But, my Lord,
what can I do? When I acted in the most regular manner, and when I
was bringing multitudes even of Dissenters themselves to croud the
churches, without any other reason being given than that too many
followed after me, I was denied the use of them. Being thus excluded,
and many thousands of ignorant souls, that perhaps would neither go
to church nor meeting-houses, being very hungry after the gospel, I
thought myself bound in duty to deal out to them the bread of life.
Being further ambitious to serve my GOD, my King, and my country, I
sacrificed my affections, and left my native soil, in order to begin
and carry on an Orphan-house in the infant colony of _Georgia_, which,
through the divine blessing, is put upon a good foundation. This served
as an introduction, though without design, to my visiting the other
parts of his Majesty’s dominions in _North-America_; and I humbly hope,
that many made truly serious in that foreign clime, will be my joy and
crown of rejoicing in the day of the LORD JESUS. If it was not for this
hope, nay, my Lord, if I was not assured, that the blessed Redeemer
(O amazing condescension) hath vouchsafed to own me for the real
conversion, and turning of many from darkness to light, the weakness of
my frequently worn out and decaying body, the innumerable temptations
that have beset my soul, together with the violent opposition I have
met with from various quarters, would long since have quite overwhelmed,
and at least have prevailed on me to accept some of those offers
that have been made me to nestle, by accepting of which I might have
screened myself from that obloquy and contempt, which, in some degree
or other, every day I have the honour to meet with for JESU’s sake.
But hitherto having obtained help from GOD, without eating a morsel of
the church of _England_’s bread, I still continue to use her liturgy,
wherever a church or chapel is allowed me, and preach up her articles,
and enforce her homilies. Your Lordship therefore judgeth exceeding
right, when you say, “I presume you do not mean to declare any dissent
from the church of _England_.”――Far be it from me; no, my Lord, unless
thrust out, I shall never leave her, and even then (as I hope whenever
it happens it will be an unjust extrusion) I shall still continue to
adhere to her doctrines, and pray for the much wished-for restoration
of her discipline, even to my dying day. Fond of displaying her truly
protestant and orthodox principles, especially when church and state
are in danger from a cruel and popish enemy, I am glad, my Lord, of
an opportunity of preaching, though it should be in a meeting-house;
and I think it discovers a good and moderate spirit in the Dissenters,
who will quietly attend on the church service, as many have done,
and continue to do at _Long-Acre_ chapel, while many, who I suppose
stile themselves her faithful sons, by very improper instruments of
reformation, have endeavoured to disturb and molest us. If the lessor
of this chapel, my Lord, hath no power to let it out, or if it be not
legally and properly licensed, I have been deceived indeed; and if upon
enquiry I find this to be the case, I shall soon declare in the most
public manner, how both your Lordship and myself have been imposed upon.
But if it appears, that the lessor hath a right to dispose of his own
property, and that the place is licensed, if not in the court books of
the Quarter Sessions, yet in the Commons or some other proper court;
and as some good, I trust, has been, and hope will yet be done by this
foolishness of preaching, surely your Lordship’s candour will overlook
a little irregularity; since I fear that in these dregs of time, these
last days, wherein we live, we must be obliged to be irregular, or
in short we must do no good at all. My Lord, I remember well, (and O
that I may more than ever obey your Lordship’s admonition) and often
recollect that awful day wherein I was ordained priest, and when
authority was given me, by my honoured friend and father good Bishop
_Benson_, to preach the word of GOD. O that the glorious exhortation,
which he delivered with so much solemnity, may be written upon the
tables of my heart! Mindful of this, I shall be always ready to go out,
and seek for CHRIST’s sheep that are dispersed abroad, and be willing
to spend and be spent for the good of his children which are in the
midst of this naughty world. Never did I so much as dream, my Lord,
that this was only a local commission, or that the condition annexed,
“Where you shall be lawfully appointed thereunto,” was to confine me
to any particular place, and that it would be unlawful for me to preach
out of it. It is plain my Lord Bishop of _Gloucester_ did not think so;
for when his secretary brought a licence for me, his Lordship said,
“It would cost me thirty shillings, and therefore I should not have
it.” And when after being presented to the late Bishop of _London_, I
applied to him for a licence, his lordship was pleased to say, “I was
going to _Georgia_, and needed none.” Accordingly I preached in most of
the London churches under his Lordship’s immediate inspection; and why
any other licence than my letters of orders should now be required, I
believe no substantial, I am positive no truly scriptural, reason can
be assigned. It is true, as your Lordship observes, there is one canon
that says, “That no curate or minister shall be permitted to serve
in any place, without examination and admission of the Bishop of
the diocese.” And there is another also, as quoted by your Lordship,
which tells us, “That neither minister, church-wardens, nor any other
officers of the church, shall suffer any man to preach within their
chapels, but such as, by shewing their licence to preach, shall appear
unto them to be sufficiently authorized thereunto.” But, my Lord, what
curacy or parsonage have I desired, or do I desire to be admitted to
serve in? Or into what church or chapel do I attempt to intrude myself,
without leave from the churchwardens or other officers? No, my Lord,
being, as I think, without cause denied admission into the churches, I
am content to take the field, and when the weather will permit, with a
table for my pulpit, and the heavens, for my sounding-board, I desire
to proclaim to all, the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. Besides,
my Lord, if this canon should be always put into full execution, I
humbly presume, that no bishop or presbyter can legally preach at any
time out of the diocese in which he is appointed to serve; consequently
no city incumbent can even occasionally be lawfully assisted by any
country clergyman, or even a bishop himself be lawfully permitted
to preach a charity sermon out of his own diocese, without a special
licence for so doing. And what a loss would that be to many noble
charities here in town? As for that other canon which your Lordship
mentions, and which runs thus, “Neither shall any minister, not
licensed as is aforesaid, presume to appoint or hold any meetings for
sermons, commonly termed by some, prophecies or exercises, in market
towns or other places, under the said pains.” I need not inform your
Lordship, that it was originally levelled against those who would not
conform to the church of _England_, and that too in such high flying
times, which I cannot believe any one of the present moderate bench
of bishops would wish to see again restored. And if this be the true
state of the case, how, my Lord, doth this canon belong to me, who
am episcopally ordained, and have very lately published a small tract
(which I humbly beg your Lordship’s acceptance of) on purpose to
recommend the communion office of the church of _England_? But, my
Lord, to come nearer to the point in hand, (and for CHRIST’s sake
let not your Lordship be offended with my using such plainness of
speech) I would, as in the presence of the living GOD, put it to your
Lordship’s conscience, whether there is one bishop or presbyter in
_England_, _Wales_, or _Ireland_, that looks upon our canons as his
rule of action? If they do, we are all perjured with a witness, and
consequently, in a very bad sense of the word, _irregular indeed_. May
I not, therefore, say on this, alluding to what my blessed Master did
on another occasion, “He that is without the sin of acting illegally,
if the canons of our church be implicitly to be obeyed, let him cast
the first stone at me and welcome.” Your Lordship knows full well, that
canons and other church laws are good and obligatory, when conformable
to the laws of CHRIST, and agreeable to the liberties of a free people;
but when invented and compiled by men of little hearts and bigotted
principles, on purpose to hinder persons of more enlarged souls from
doing good, or being more extensively useful, they become mere _bruta
fulmina_; and when made use of only as cords to bind up the hands of
a zealous few, that honestly appear for their King, their country,
and their GOD, like the withes with which the _Philistines_ bound
_Sampson_, in my opinion, they may very legally be broken. What pains
and penalties are to be incurred for such offence, (as I have not the
canons at present before me) I cannot tell; but for my own part, my
Lord, if any penalty is incurred, or any pain to be inflicted upon
me, for prophesying or preaching against sin, the Pope, and the devil,
and for recommending the strictest loyalty to the best of princes, his
Majesty King _George_, in this metropolis, or any other part of his
Majesty’s dominions, I trust, through grace, I shall be enabled to say,

              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain!_

I think there now remains but one more particular in your Lordship’s
letter to be answered:――your Lordship’s truly apostolical canon taken
out of _2 Corinthians x. 16_; upon turning to, and reading of which, I
could not help thinking, my Lord, of a passage I once met with in good
Mr. _Philip Henry_’s life. It was this: Being ejected out of the church,
and yet thinking it his duty to preach, he used now and then to give
the people of _Broad-Oaks_, where he lived, a gospel sermon; and one
day, as he was coming from his exercise, and meeting with the incumbent,
he thus addressed him: “Sir, I have been taking the liberty of throwing
a handful of seed into your field.” “Have you so, said the good man?
may GOD give it his blessing! There is work enough for us both.” This,
my Lord, I humbly conceive, is the case not only of your Lordship, but
of every minister’s parish in _London_, and every bishop’s diocese in
_England_; and therefore as good is done, and souls are benefited, I
hope your Lordship will not regard a little irregularity, since at the
worst, it is only the irregularity of doing well. But supposing this
should not be admitted as an excuse at other seasons, I would hope it
will have its weight at this critical juncture, wherein, if there were
ten thousand sound preachers, and each preacher had a thousand tongues,
they could not well be too frequently employed in calling upon the
inhabitants of _Great-Britain_ to be upon their guard, against the
cruel and malicious designs of _France_, of _Rome_, and of hell. After
all, my Lord, if your Lordship will be pleased to apply to Mr. _B――――_
himself, (who, I suppose, knows where the place is registered) or if
upon enquiry I shall find, that the lessor hath no power to let it out,
as I hate and abhor every dishonourable action, after my setting out
for _Bristol_, which I expect to do in a few days, I shall decline
preaching in the chapel any more. But if the case should appear to be
otherwise, I hope your Lordship will not be angry, if I persist in this,
I trust not unpardonable, irregularity: for if I decline preaching in
every place, meerly because the incumbent may be unwilling I should
come into his parish, I fear I must seldom or never preach at all;
and this, my Lord, especially at this juncture, when all our civil and
religious liberties are as it were at stake, would to me be worse than
death itself. I humbly ask pardon for detaining your Lordship so long,
but being willing to give your Lordship all the satisfaction I possibly
could, I have chosen rather to sit up and deny myself proper repose,
than to let your Lordship’s candid letter lie by me one moment longer
than was absolutely necessary. I return your Lordship a thousand thanks
for your favourable opinion of me, and good wishes, and begging the
continuance of your Lordship’s blessing, and earnestly praying, that
whenever your Lordship shall be called hence, you may give up your
account with joy, I beg leave to subscribe myself, my Lord,

             Your Lordship’s most dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

                               _Tabernacle-House, February 23, 1756._

_My Lord_,

SINCE I had the honour of writing my last letter to your Lordship, I
have made inquiry, and find that the certificate is in the hands of one
Mr. _Culverwell_, with whom Mr. _Gardiner_ lodges. I think he told me,
the place was licensed in the Commons, and as far as I can judge, Mr.
_Barnard_’s committee do not intend to let the chapel go out of their
hands. As therefore, your Lordship would undoubtedly chuse that the
church liturgy should be read in it sometimes, rather than it should be
entirely made use of in a non-conformist way, I hope your Lordship will
not be offended, if I go on as usual after my return from _Bristol_.
I assure your Lordship, through the divine blessing, real good hath
been done; and therefore I am sorry to inform your Lordship, that
notwithstanding the admonitions I hear your Lordship hath given them,
some unhappy persons have still endeavoured to disturb us, by making
an odd kind of a noise in a neighbouring house. I hear that some of
them belong to your Lordship’s vestry, and therefore wish that your
Lordship would so far interpose, as to order them once more to stop
their proceedings. But I only just mention it, and shall leave it to
your Lordship’s discretion. I can only entreat the continuance of your
Lordship’s blessing, and begging your Lordship’s acceptance of a short
address I am now publishing, I hasten to subscribe myself, my Lord,

             Your Lordship’s most dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

YESTERDAY I received your kind letter, and this morning I send you
a few lines by way of _New-York_. May they find you and all my dear
_Boston_ friends strong, yea very strong in the LORD, and in the
power of his might. Every day do I make mention of them, and dear
_New-England_, in my sermons and prayers. Thousands I trust are
interceding for you continually. Last night I preached upon _Moses_’s
praying on the mount, whilst _Joshua_ fought against _Amalek_ in
the valley. I hope some spiritual shot went after the fleet, that we
hear is gone to _America_. What awaits us here at home, the Redeemer
only knows. We deserve the greatest scourge, but I trust we have too
many praying people amongst us, to have such a one as the threatened
invasion, laid upon our backs.――The event will prove. Blessed be GOD,
for the effects of the late earthquake. May they be lasting! no doubt
they will be upon some. The awakening at _London_ continues, and more
ministers are coming out for the ever-blessed JESUS. Last Lord’s day
I opened my spring campaign, by preaching thrice in the fields to many
thousands in _Gloucestershire_. O that I may begin to begin to spring
for my GOD! I trust you and my other never to be forgotten friends will
not fail to remember us here. Though at such a distance, we can meet at
the throne of grace. Why does not dear Mr. _S――――_ send me one line? I
desire to be remembered in the kindest manner to him, and his, and all
my dear, very dear friends. I can now add no more, but hoping to have
another opportunity, I beg leave to subscribe myself, with tender
affection to your whole self,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXII.


                       _To the Bishop of B――――._

                                  _Tabernacle-House, March 20, 1756._

_My Lord_,

TO my great surprize, upon my coming up to town, I found that the
disturbances so justly complained of near _Long-Acre_ chapel, had
been continued. On _Thursday_ evening last, when I preached there
myself, they were rather increased. Notwithstanding some of the windows
were stopped up, to prevent in some degree the congregations being
disturbed by the unhallowed noise, yet large stones were thrown in at
another window, and one young person badly wounded. This constrains
me to trouble your Lordship once more, and to beg the favour of your
Lordship so far to interpose, as to desire the persons belonging to
your Lordship’s vestry, to desist from such irregular proceedings. For
my own irregularity in preaching, I am ready at any time to answer;
and was I myself the only sufferer, I should be entirely unconcerned
whatever personal ill treatment I might meet with in the way of my
duty. But to have the lives of his Majesty’s loyal subjects endangered,
when they come peaceably to worship GOD, and to pray for his long
and prosperous reign, is an irregularity, which I am persuaded your
Lordship will look upon as unjustifiable in the sight of GOD, and of
every good man. However, as a subject to King _George_, and a minister
of JESUS CHRIST, I know your Lordship will allow, I have a right to
do myself justice, and therefore, I hope, if the disturbances be yet
continued, your Lordship will not be offended, if I lay a plain and
fair narration of the whole affair, together with what hath passed
between your Lordship and myself, before the world. I beg your Lordship
not to look upon this as a threatning, or as done with an intent to
expose; I scorn any such mean procedure. But as providence seems to
point out such a method, I hope your Lordship will have no just reason
to censure me, if it be pursued by, my Lord,

             Your Lordship’s most dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXIII.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                            _London, March 22, 1756._

_Honoured Sir_,

THE long and intimate acquaintance I formerly had with Mr. _N――――_ and
Lady _Jane_, would have induced me to send you the inclosed some weeks
past, as a mark of unfeigned respect due to you for your personal worth
and character; but I heard, that both Lord _M――――_ and yourself were
out of town: accept it therefore, honoured Sir, though late. I likewise
want to consult you on account of a very indecent, and I think illegal
disturbance, that hath been made for many weeks last past, whilst I
have been preaching at _Long-Acre_ chapel. Several have been sadly
wounded, and I fear the same fate awaits more, unless those that have
hitherto disturbed us, are some way or other restrained. Did I know
when it would suit you, I would wait upon you in person, and acquaint
you with particulars. In the mean while, praying that he, who is the
wonderful Counsellor, and who hath so richly furnished you with talents
for your country’s service, may more and more improve you for such
noble purposes, I beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured Sir,

                       Your very humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXIV.


                       _To the Bishop of B――――._

                                            _London, March 25, 1756._

I HEARTILY thank your Lordship for your kind acceptance of my three
small tracts, and my very long letter dated _February_ 16th.――At
the same time, I acknowledge myself concerned, that any thing I have
written since, should prevent your Lordship’s pointing out to me any
mistakes, which I may lie under in regard to the canons. GOD knows,
if I do err, it is for want of better information; and therefore if
your Lordship will vouchsafe to favour me with the letter prepared for
that purpose, it shall be most thankfully received, most impartially
examined, most explicitly replied to, but withal never exposed to
the view of the world. Your Lordship needed not to inform me of the
privilege of a Peer, to deter me from publishing your Lordship’s
letters without first asking leave. I thank GOD, I have not so learned
CHRIST. By his help, nothing shall be done in that way, which is the
least inconsistent with the strictest honour, justice and simplicity.
But I hope, if a public account of the repeated disturbances at
_Long-Acre_ chapel should be rendered necessary, your Lordship will not
esteem it unreasonable in me, to inform the world, what previous steps
were taken to prevent and stop them. Surely such a scene, at such a
juncture, and under such a government, as has been transacted in your
Lordship’s parish, in the house or yard of one Mr. _Cope_, who I hear
is your Lordship’s overseer, ever since last _Twelfth-Day_, I believe
is not to be met with in _English_ history. Indeed, my Lord, it is more
than noise. It deserves no milder a name than _premeditated rioting_.
Drummers, soldiers, and many of the baser sort, have been hired by
subscription.――A copper-furnace, bells, drums, clappers, marrow bones
and cleavers, and such like instruments of reformation, have been
provided for, and made use of, by them repeatedly, from the moment I
have begun preaching, to the end of my sermon. By these horrid noises,
many women have been almost frightened to death, and mobbers encouraged
thereby to come and riot at the chapel door during the time of divine
service, and then insult and abuse me and the congregation after it
hath been over. Not content with this, the chapel windows, while I
have been preaching, have repeatedly been broken by large stones of
almost a pound weight (some now lying by me) which though levelled at,
providentially missed me, but at the same time sadly wounded some of
my hearers. Mr. _C――――_, one of your Lordship’s relations, can acquaint
your Lordship with many more particulars, and if your Lordship would
be so good as only to ride to Mr. _C――――_’s house, you would see such
a scaffold (unless taken down) and such costly preparations for a noise
upon it, that must make the ears of all that shall hear it to tingle.
Indeed last _Tuesday_ night all was hush’d,――and in order to throw off
all popular odium, I gave it as my opinion, that it was owing to your
Lordship’s kind interposition. One Mr. _C――――_ and one Mr. _M――――_, I
am informed, are parties greatly concerned. I know them not, and I pray
the LORD of all Lords never to lay this ill and unmerited treatment
to their charge. If no more noise is made on their part, I assure
your Lordship no further resentment shall be made on mine. But if they
persist, I have the authority of the Apostle on a like occasion, to
appeal unto _Cæsar_.――And thanks be to GOD, we have a _Cæsar_ to appeal
to, whose laws will not suffer any of his loyal subjects to be used in
such an inhuman manner. I have only one favour to beg of your Lordship,
that “you would send (as they are your Lordship’s parishioners) to
the above gentlemen, and desire them henceforward to desist from such
unchristian (and especially at this critical juncture) such riotous and
dangerous proceedings.” Whether as a Chaplain to a most worthy Peeress,
a Presbyter of the church of _England_, and a steady disinterested
friend to our present happy constitution, I have not a right to
ask such a favour, I leave to your Lordship’s mature deliberation.
Henceforward, I hope no more to trouble your Lordship; but committing
my cause to him, who judgeth righteously, I beg leave to subscribe
myself, my Lord,

             Your Lordship’s most dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXXV.


                            _To ―――― ――――._

                                             _London, April 1, 1756._

_Gentlemen_,

YOUR obliging letter came to hand last night. As my influence I fear
was but very small, it scarce called for such an acknowledgment. I
trust, my views to serve my GOD and my King are disinterested; and
therefore I shall always think it my duty to espouse their cause, who
are firmly united in the bonds of friendship and social love, to defend
the protestant interest, and the glorious privileges we enjoy under our
dread and rightful sovereign King _George_. Such a union I take yours
to be.――That you may therefore meet with success on earth, and by
an infinitely superior union (I mean that of your souls with GOD) be
prepared for a never-ceasing union with the spirits of just men made
perfect in heaven, is and shall be the hearty prayer of, Gentlemen,

                     Your obliged humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXVI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. B――――._

                                             _London, April 3, 1756._

_My dear Friend_,

NONE but he, whose name and nature is love, can tell what I felt at
the receipt of your kind letter. O how did the welfare of dear never to
be forgotten _New England_, lie upon my heart. How could I have wished
for the wings of a dove to fly thither! The delightful interviews we
have had together, when in the confidence of social prayer we have laid
hold on GOD, came so fresh upon my mind, that I knew not what to do.
O come, LORD JESUS, come quickly, that friendship begun on earth, may
be consummated in the kingdom of heaven! He only knows, what awaits us
here below, before we are called to live with him above. _England_ is
now equally threatened with _America_. Let this be our comfort, “the
LORD reigneth.” Nothing can rob us of our CHRIST,――let us help each
other by mutual prayer. Thousands here hold up their hands daily for
you. I know you will gladly return the favour. You would be pleased
to see how eagerly people attend the word. I think the awakening, and
prospect of doing good in _London_, is as great as ever. Satan hath
raged at a place called _Long-Acre_ chapel, near the play-houses,
but you know who hath promised to bruise him under our feet. Send me
what good news you can from your side the water, and assure all the
followers of the Lamb of GOD, that they are upon my poor heart night
and day. How goes on your son _Daniel_? May he greatly be beloved!
I could fill, yea more than fill a sheet, but with great difficulty
I write this. Adieu, my dear friend, for the present. I shall never
forget our last pleasant short journey. Surely our hearts burned within
us, when we talked of JESUS in the way. I can no more.

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXVII.


                    _To the Honourable Hume C――――._

                                         _Canterbury, April 9, 1756._

_Honoured Sir_,

YOUR kind behaviour when I had the pleasure of waiting upon you,
emboldens me to trouble you with the inclosed. It is the copy of
an anonymous letter, that was sent to my house on _Tuesday_ last,
just after I left town, and forwarded hither to me by my wife the day
following. As I am satisfied that the LORD reigneth, and that a sparrow
doth not fall to the ground without the knowledge of our heavenly
Father, its contents in respect to myself, I thank GOD, do not much
alarm me. But as others are concerned, and it is an affair that hath
reference to the welfare of civil government, I would beg the favour
of your advice. Next _Tuesday_ I expect to return to _London_, and on
_Wednesday_ morning, purpose, GOD willing, to wait upon you in person.
In the mean while, I beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured Sir,

                   Your most obliged humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXXVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                        _Canterbury, April 10, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THE letter on the other side, was sent to me last _Tuesday_. By that,
your Ladyship may see to what an height the opposition hath risen at
_Long-Acre_; indeed the noise hath been infernal. For a night it was
stopped, but I have reason to think there was a secret design for my
life; some of my friends were sadly used; they applied for warrants,
and that occasioned this letter. I have written to Mr. _H―――― C――――_
for advice. May the wonderful Counsellor direct me how to act! Here,
all is peaceable. It is most delightful to see the soldiers flock to
hear the word; officers likewise attend very orderly. On _Monday_ I
return, GOD willing, to _London_. LORD JESUS, do thou prepare me for
whatever thou hast prepared for me! Baron _Munchausen_ hath been very
kind in _Long-Acre_ affair; I would if possible hush all up, but I know
no other way but holding my tongue. O this enmity of heart! This is my
comfort,――“the LORD reigneth.” I hope to answer Mrs. _G――――_ soon. At
present, I have scarce time to beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s
prayers, and to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                            _London, April 18, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

SINCE my last from _Canterbury_, I have received two more letters of a
like kind with the former. Before they came to hand I was exceedingly
comforted, from whence I inferred a further storm lay before me. My
greatest distress is, how to act so as to avoid rashness on the one
hand, and timidity on the other. I have been introduced to the Earl
of _H――――ss_, who received me very courteously, and seemed to make
no objection against issuing out a reward for the discovery of the
letter-writer. Whether I had best accept it, I know not. Sir _H――――
C――――_ says, it is not felony; and he advises me by all means to put
all concerned into the court of _King’s Bench_. The facts are most
flagrant. LORD JESUS direct me for thy mercy’s sake! A man came up to
me in the pulpit at the tabernacle; GOD knows, what was his design:
I see no other way for me to act, than either resolutely to persist
in preaching and prosecuting, or entirely to desist from preaching,
which I think would bring intolerable guilt upon my soul, and give the
adversary cause to blaspheme. Blessed be GOD, I am clear, quite clear
in the occasion of my suffering. It is for preaching CHRIST JESUS, and,
for his great name’s sake, loyalty to King _George_, to whom under GOD
I owe the liberty of preaching many years. Alas! alas! what a condition
would this land be in, was the protestant interest not to prevail? Glad
should I be to die by the hands of an assassin, if popery is to get
footing here. I shall then be taken away from the evil to come. I hope
that your Ladyship, and the good Ladies with you, will have hearts
given you to pray for me, that, whether by life or by death, JESUS may
be glorified. Thanks be to GOD, to me to live is CHRIST, and to die
will be my gain. He knows, that with simplicity and godly sincerity,
I have endeavoured to promote in my feeble way his honour and glory. I
should be glad of a line of advice from your Ladyship; this is giving
trouble I no way deserve, but as your Ladyship is pleased to honour me
with your friendship, it will be adding to the innumerable obligations
already conferred upon, honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready Servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXXX.


                           _To Mrs. G――――._

                                            _London, April 20, 1756._

_Dear Madam_,

IT hath given me concern, that I could not answer your kind letter till
now; but making a short excursion abroad, and fighting with a kind of
beasts at home, hath prevented me. I fancy that something we cannot
see is behind the curtain. Satan seems to have overshot himself. O
what a mercy is it, dear Madam, to be rescued from his slavery! Nothing
less than an Almighty arm could bring about such a great salvation.
Its depths, its lengths, its breadths, who can fathom? By being plunged
into the first, we stretch and rise into the two last. Our Saviour’s
death preceded his resurrection, and his resurrection that of his
glorious ascension into heaven.――So must we die, and rise, in order to
ascend hereafter where he is gone before. No matter if a sudden stroke
opens the passage: God grant I may be always ready! I hope that you,
dear Madam, and the other elect Ladies, have hearts given you to pray
for me. Hitherto the LORD hath helped me. I thank Mr. _S――――_ for
his hint. If occasion requires, I shall improve it. O for a steady
disinterested zeal for my GOD, my King, and my country! Welcome death,
when brought upon me in defence of these. As I expect to be called
away every moment, I can only add, after sending my most cordial and
grateful acknowledgments to the whole _Clifton_ court, that I am, dear
Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXI.


                           _To Mrs. D――――._

                                            _London, April 21, 1756._

_Dear Madam_,

I HAVE heard by several hands, that you are lately entered into a
new relation of life. Gratitude constrains me to wish you joy, and
earnestly to pray, that you and Mr. _D――――_ may live together as
heirs of the grace of life, and bring forth much fruit unto GOD in the
decline of age. This is a changing world; but we are hastening towards
an unchangeable state, where we shall neither marry nor be given in
marriage, but be like unto the angels of GOD. For this I am waiting
day by day. Many seem to be quickened in this work too; though at the
other end of the town, amongst some of the popish party, I have lately
met with much opposition. But we know who hath promised to tread Satan
shortly under our feet. I hope this will find you, my dear Madam, and
my other _Charles-Town_ friends, going on from conquering to conquer.
I do not, I cannot forget them. I send them my most cordial love and
respects, and beg you and Mr. _D――――_ to accept the same from, dear
Madam,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXII.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                            _London, April 21, 1756._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

YOUR last kind letter is come to hand.――By that, I find poor _N――――
P――――_ is engaged, and that some good friends in _Carolina_ have been
instrumental in drawing him from the care of a family, over which I
thought divine providence had made him overseer, and where I imagined
he intended to have abode at least for some years.――I know not what
reason I have given him, to suspect my confidence was weakened towards
him.――I could do no more than trust him with my all, and place him
at the head of my affairs and family without the least check or
controul.――Add to all this, that notwithstanding the disparity of
age, I consented that he should have my dear friend’s sister, with
whom I thought he might live most usefully and happily at _Bethesda_,
if you pleased, as long as you both should sojourn here below: and
you know what satisfaction I expressed when I took my leave.――But it
seems my scheme is disconcerted, and my family like to be brought into
confusion.――Alas, my dear Mrs. _C――――_, if this be the case, whom can I
send that I may hope will _continue disinterested long_? But you know,
this is not the first time that I have been wounded in the house of
my friends.――However, I trust the wound is not incurable.――Till I can
procure a proper Latin master, I should think Mr. _Dixon_, &c. might
do in the school, and if you think _George Whitefield_ would do for the
house, he might be gradually bred up for it.――If not, I shall write to
Mr. _T――――_ and _Edn――――_ of _Charles-Town_ to get him a place there:
upon the whole, I believe this would be best. _Joseph P――――_ I design
for _New-Jersey_ college, and shall send particular orders concerning
him in my next by _Cheeseman_.――Your brothers are very fond of your
marriage with Mr. _D――――_. I am quite free for it.――May GOD bless
you both together; I cannot think of parting with you for any body I
know.――GOD bless and direct you to do his will! Never fear; GOD will
be _Bethesda_’s GOD.――He knows the way that I take; when I am tried I
shall come forth like gold.――Will not Mr. _D――――_ and you be a proper
check upon the overseer? As I think at the bottom he is honest, I can
scarce provide myself with a better. Gladly would I come over, but at
present it is impracticable. I must throw my affairs into the hands of
my GOD and you. I pity those who without cause have troubled my envied
camp. Well, my dear Mrs. _C――――_, let us remember, that though the bush
burned it was not consumed. And why? because the LORD was in the midst
of it. He hath spoken to us many times out of the bush, and so he will
again. I know you must have been in the furnace: but our affections
must be crucified. I pity Dr. ―――― from the bottom of my heart. Never
was I wrote to or served so by any from _Bethesda_ before. LORD JESUS,
lay it not to his charge! LORD JESUS, suffer us not to be led into
temptation! I did not think to write so much. I rather choose to
spread all before _Bethesda_’s GOD. But you will not misimprove it. By
_Maclellan_ I hope to hear more particulars. GOD willing, they shall be
answered. My wife will get you the things sent for. I have no thoughts
at present of her ever seeing the Orphan-house again. Blessed be GOD,
we shall ere long see heaven. Some antepasts of it we are favoured
with daily. Though lately my life hath been threatened at the other
end of the town, JESUS can and will guard me. This evening I am to bury
_Wittern_’s mother: she died triumphant. Adieu for the present. GOD
bless you all. I am, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

             Your most affectionate, sympathizing friend,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXXXIII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                            _London, April 25, 1756._

_My dear Mr. C――――_,

BY this time I thought to have been moving towards _Bristol_, but
am detained in town, by endeavouring to put a stop to the dreadful
uproar made at _Long-Acre_ chapel. Such an infernal continued noise,
on such an occasion, at such a juncture, under such a government, I
believe was never heard of before. To complete the scene, I have had
three anonymous letters sent me, “threatening a certain, sudden, and
unavoidable stroke, unless I desist from preaching, and pursuing the
offenders by law.” You have guessed at the quarter from whence it comes.
Blessed be GOD, it is for speaking in behalf of the glorious JESUS, and
our dread and rightful sovereign King _George_ and his government. Mr.
_S――――_ hath been so good as to go with me to the Earl of _H――――_’s,
from whom I hope this week some redress will be obtained. On _Thursday_
next, I am to wait upon his Excellency again. Mine eyes are waiting on
the blessed JESUS, from whom all salvation must come. Ere long I hope
to shew you the letters; they are indeed very extraordinary. O the
enmity of the heart! LORD, help us! What would become of us, if some
folks were to have the upper hand? Our cause, in my opinion, is the
cause of GOD, and the cause of civil and religious liberty; and if
death itself should be permitted to befall me for defending it, I hope
through CHRIST strengthening me, it would be gratefully received by,
my dear Sir,

                Your most obliged, affectionate friend,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXIV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                               _London, May 2, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

VARIOUS have been my exercises since I wrote to your Ladyship last. But
I find, that out of the eater cometh forth meat, and that all things
happen for the furtherance of the gospel. I suppose your Ladyship hath
seen his Majesty’s promise of a pardon to any that will discover the
letter writer; and this brings your Ladyship the further news of my
having taken a piece of ground very commodious to build on, not far
from the Foundling-Hospital. On _Sunday_ I opened the subscription, and
through GOD’s blessing, it hath already amounted to near six hundred
pounds. If he is pleased to continue to smile upon my poor endeavours,
and to open the hearts of some more of his dear children to contribute,
I hope in a few months to have what hath been long wanted,――a place
for the gospel at the other end of the town. This evening, GOD willing,
I venture once more to preach at _Long-Acre_. The enemy boasts that I
am frightened away: but the triumph of the wicked is short. Our people,
Sir _H―――― C――――_, Mr. _M――――_, &c. are all for bringing the rioters to
the King’s-Bench, and perhaps upon the whole it may be best. LORD JESUS,
direct my goings in thy way! On _Tuesday_ next I hope to set out for
_Wales_. For indeed my body is weakened through care and watchfulness,
a variety of exercises, and want of sleep. But the Redeemer’s grace is
all-sufficient. To his tender and never-failing mercy do I most humbly
commend your Ladyship, and the other elect Ladies, and beg a continued
interest in their prayers. With repeated thanks for repeated favours;
I subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXV.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                             _Bristol, May 20, 1756._

_My very dear Sir_,

FOR so I must address myself, having had you in a peculiar manner
upon my heart, ever since I saw and read a letter that came from you
some months ago. It bespoke the language of a heart devoted to the
ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. Mrs. _B――――_ confirmed me in this
opinion yesterday, and withal told me, she believed you would be glad
of a line from me, who am indeed less than the least of all saints,
but willing, if I know any thing of my own heart, to spend and be spent
for the good of souls. They are redeemed by the blood of JESUS, whose
cross, blessed be his name, hath been made delightful to me for some
years. I thank GOD that I am cast out for my Master’s sake. Indeed,
my very dear Sir, it is preferable to all other preferment whatsoever.
It is the way to the crown. Glory be to GOD, that there are some young
champions coming forth: methinks I could now sing my _nunc dimittis_
with triumphant joy. Though I decrease, may you, my very dear Sir,
increase. O that you may be kept from conferring with flesh and blood!
O that you may be owned and blessed of GOD! I believe you will, and
never more so than when you are reviled and despised by man. It is
a fatal mistake, to think we must keep our characters in order to do
good; this is called _prudence_; in most, I fear, it is _trimming_.
Honesty I find always to be the best policy. They who honour JESUS, he
will honour. Even in this world, if we confess him, his truth, and his
people, we shall receive an hundred-fold. To lose all in this respect,
is to find all. But whither am I going? Excuse, my very dear Sir,
the overflowings of a heart, that loves you dearly for the glorious
Redeemer’s sake. I am here preaching his cross, and expect to stay over
_Sunday_. Next week I have thoughts of being at _Bath_ and _Westbury_.
I lead a pilgrim life. You will pray that I may have a pilgrim heart.
Ere long I hope my heavenly father will take me home. I am ambitious;
I want to sit upon a throne. JESUS hath purchased and provided a throne
and heaven for me. That you may have an exalted place at his right hand,
is and shall be the earnest prayer of, reverend and very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXVI.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                             _Bristol, May 21, 1756._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

THE first part of your letter made me smile: for what? Because I was
glad to find you had such an enlarged heart, and at the same time
imagined, that I could build two houses at a time. If the top-stone of
one is brought forth, I shall think we have reason to shout unto it,
Grace! grace! This I hope will be the happy lot of you and your young
fellow-soldiers, in respect to your spiritual building. Remember, war
is proclaimed; the sword is unsheathed; the devil, the world, and the
flesh will dispute every inch of ground, and you must fight or die.
Angels stand by to see the combat, and JESUS stands ready to make you
more than conquerors through his love. Provoke then one another, but
let it be to love and to good works. Take heed of a trifling spirit
when together. It will hurt you, and by degrees rob you of true and
holy joy. I thank you for remembering unworthy me. I am called to
travel, you to trade for JESUS. Last week, I trust, was a good week.
The Lord of the harvest is pleased to smile upon us here. I hope to be
in town at the appointed time. I hope that dear Mr. _J――――_ prospers
every day. Pray remember me to him, and your single circle, in the most
tender manner, and believe me to be, my dear Sir,

              Your affectionate friend and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXXXVII.


                         _To Mr. J―――― R――――._

                                             _Bristol, May 21, 1756._

_My dear Sir_,

THIS morning, (which is the first leisure time I have had since my
leaving town) looking over my letters, I found one from you, who I
suppose to be the person whom I have taken notice of at _Long-Acre_
chapel. As your behaviour there, and your letter before me, bespeak
you to be in earnest about your soul, you will be quite welcome to come
to my house; and if GOD should vouchsafe to bless any thing that I may
drop for the furtherance of your faith, to him and him alone be all the
glory. I desire to bless him for what he hath already done. O amazing
mercy! to be translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
of GOD’s dear Son; to be brought from the swine’s trough to feed upon
the fatted calf; what a heaven upon earth is this! Be not discouraged,
though you are obliged to fight every inch of your way. JESUS will pray
for you, and your faith shall not fail. He can and will enable you to
overcome yourself and the world. To his never-failing mercy do I most
earnestly commit you, as being, for his great name’s sake,

                       Your friend and servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXXXVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. V――――._

                                              _London, June 4, 1756._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

GLAD, yea very glad was I to hear by Mr. _A――――_, that you grew better
and better every day. Surely your late sickness was only to purge
you, that you might bring forth more fruit unto GOD. Such trying and
threatening dispensations are glorious presages of future usefulness.
It is in the furnace, that both our gifts and graces are purified and
increased. How gradually doth our great, compassionate, and all-wise
High-priest train up his chosen ones for the services appointed to
them! Happy they that can eye his providences, and with a disinterested
spirit be ready to follow the Lamb whithersoever he is pleased to lead
them.

                Through winds and clouds and storms,
                  He gently clears our way;
                Wait we his time, so shall each night
                  Be turn’d to joyous day.

I rejoice in the prospect of your coming forth like gold that is tried.
May you increase though I decrease! Justly might my Master throw me
aside; but he is patient and long-suffering, and will send by whom
he will send. Since we parted, I have been led to several new places.
Travelling and preaching thrice a day was made delightful. Blessed be
GOD for my airy pluralities! O what am I, LORD, that I should be sent
into the highways and hedges!

                All hail reproach, and welcome pain,
                Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain!

These I cannot bear. A Father’s, a Saviour’s frowns are intolerable.
But what am I doing? Excuse this freedom, because it flows from love.
How does dear Mr. _D――――_? How are the elect Ladies? If possible I
shall write to-night; if not, very soon. I am glad Miss _G――――_ is in
such a promising way. She nor any of our honoured friends are forgotten
in my poor prayers. If I should be prevented from writing, be pleased
to present my most dutiful respects, and accept most cordial love and
salutations from, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXXXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                              _London, June 4, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

MAN appoints, but GOD disappoints. In hopes of seeing your Ladyship,
I hastened to _Bristol_, but found your Ladyship had been in _London_
whilst I was there. Sorry was I for the occasion of your Ladyship’s
journey, and yet glad to hear that Master _H――――_ was so well recovered.
At _Bristol_ the Redeemer caused us to triumph, and likewise in
_Gloucestershire_, at _Bradford_, _Frome_, _Warminster_, and at
_Portsmouth_, whither I have been these three weeks last past. I am
now come up for about ten days to keep Pentecost; I trust it will be a
Pentecost to many souls at _Long-Acre_. Blessed be GOD, a new building
is now erecting at _Tottenham-Court Road_: Mr. _J――――_ promises to
assist me. We have consulted the Commons, about putting it under your
Ladyship’s protection. This is the answer: “No nobleman can licence a
chapel, or in any manner have one put in his dwelling house; that the
chapel must be a private one, and not with doors to the street for any
persons to resort to at pleasure, for then it becomes a public one;
that a chapel cannot be built and used as such, without the consent
of the parson of the parish, and when it is done with his consent,
no minister can preach therein, without licence of the Bishop of the
diocese.” There seems then to be but one way,――to licence it as our
other houses are: and thanks be to JESUS for that liberty which we
have. O that I could begin to work while it is day. My GOD! half the
year gone, and so little, yea very little done for thee! I have need
of being purged, that I may at length bring forth some fruit unto GOD.
Glory be to his great name, he doth not say, “Let him alone.” Outward
and inward trials frequently surround me; but, by the help of my GOD,
I shall leap over every wall. I know your Ladyship will not forget to
pray for me. My poor prayers are always offered up for your Ladyship
and honoured family. That is the only pepper-corn of acknowledgment
that can be made by, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXL.


                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                             _London, June 10, 1756._

_My very dear Friend_,

WHAT shall I say? Had I wings, how gladly would I fly to my dear
_America_? But alas! the glittering sword is now unsheathed, and I fear
it would not be proper for me to cross the water now. However, all the
provinces are continually upon my heart: night and day do I remember
them before GOD. Satan hath been angry with me for appearing for my
JESUS, my King, and my country. If you examine the _Gazette_ for the
latter end of _April_, or beginning of _May_, you will see what it
hath produced. My life hath been threatened, but we are immortal till
our work is done. A new building is now erecting at the other end of
the town, the top-stone of which, I trust, will be brought forth with
shoutings, and we shall cry Grace! grace! People are rather more eager
than ever to hear the word. I remark what you say about _Georgia_, and
shall talk with Mr. _D――――_. The good LORD JESUS direct you in every
step! What if you went and lived at _Bethesda_, and took all my outward
affairs upon your hands, and furnished the family with all it wanted.
Glad should I be of such a steward, and of such a steward’s wife as
I know dear Mrs. _G――――_ would prove. Poor _P――――_ hath served me as
others before him have done. GOD keep us from that prosperity which
destroyeth! In all time of our wealth, good LORD deliver us! Let
me hear from you concerning _Bethesda_. Watch and pray. I send most
cordial respects to you and yours, and all dear friends that are so
kind to enquire after, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXLI.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, June 10, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

BEING just come off the bed, where I have been sweating for a cold and
cholic that had seized me this day, I met with your Ladyship’s very
kind and condescending letter. I see your Ladyship is touched in a very
tender point: generous minds are always thus affected, when a friend is
abused. But I find more and more, honoured Madam, that our own mother’s
children will be permitted to be angry with one. The contradiction
of saints, is more trying than that of sinners:――but it is all to
teach us to cease from man, and wrap ourselves in Him, in whom alone
dwells consummate perfection. That I might say, “some of Mr. _L――――_’s
principles, in my opinion, are wrong,” I do not deny; but that I put
Mr. _W――――y_ upon writing, or had any active hand in his pamphlet,
is utterly false. I think it is a most ungentleman-like, injudicious,
unchristian piece. However, Mr. _L――――_ knows too much of the divine
life, not to see some call even in this cross; and I hope your Ladyship
will not suffer it to burden your mind any longer. Satan wants to
disturb your Ladyship’s repose. Ere long, blessed be the glorious
_Emmanuel_, he will be bruised under our feet. This last week I have
had some respite from his artful and perplexing suggestions, and have
been enabled to ride upon my high places. My present work at _London_
seems to be over, and _Monday_ or _Tuesday_ next, GOD willing, I hope
to set out for _Bristol_, where I purpose preaching next _Thursday_.
If divine Providence should not direct your Ladyship thither, I have
thought of coming through _Leicestershire_, in my way to _Scotland_.
This circuit, I hope, will be a three months circuit. The prospect
in _London_ is very promising. Every day we hear of fresh conquests.
To thee, and thee alone, most adorable Redeemer, be all the glory!
Want of strength forbids my enlarging. O this vile body! Surely our
treasure is in earthly vessels. When it is breaking to pieces, and the
rattles are in my throat, I hope with my latest breath to acknowledge
the innumerable unmerited favours which have been conferred by your
Ladyship on, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXLII.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                             _London, June 21, 1756._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

NOTHING concerns me in your last letter, but your having the least
suspicion that I was not pleased with your conduct, or was not
satisfied with your being at _Bethesda_. I know of no person in the
world that I would prefer to you, neither had I ever one thought to
the contrary. I think myself happy in having such a mother for the
poor children, and am persuaded GOD will bless and own you more and
more. I pity poor Mr. _P――――_, but doubt not of _Bethesda_’s being
well supplied. I think if Mr. _R――――_ manages outward things, and Mr.
_D――――_ takes the accounts, and keeps to the children, affairs may
be managed very well. I care not how much the family is lessened. As
it is a time of war, this may be done with great propriety, and then
the plantation will have time to grow. _J―――― H――――y_ writes that
you use him quite well, and seems very contented. Never fear, my dear
Mrs. _C――――_, JESUS will stand by a disinterested cause. I have aimed
at nothing in founding _Bethesda_, but his glory and the good of my
country. Let _Lots_ then chuse the _plain_, GOD will be _Abrahams_’
shield and exceeding great reward. All is well that ends well. Faith
and patience must be exercised by means of friends as well as by foes.
I hear that my nephew is married. Alas, what a changing world do we
live in! Blessed be GOD for an unchangeable CHRIST! Amidst all, this
is my comfort, his word runs and is glorified. A new building is now
erecting at the other end of the town, and many souls, I trust, are
daily built up in their most holy faith. To-morrow, GOD willing, I set
out upon a long range. Fain would I have all concerned with me to be
happy. Just now Mrs. _F――――_ hath determined to come over and marry
_H――――_. I have advised her to go with _M――――_, and told her she should
be welcome to my house till she goes to _Carolina_. I know you will
receive her kindly. It is her own choice, and therefore she must look
to the consequences. The LORD give us all a right judgment in all
things. Near this time, I suppose, you know my mind about Mr. _D――――_.
I have no objection, and your brothers are quite fond of the match.
Perhaps, take all together, it may be more agreeable than the other.
We seldom choose well, when we choose for ourselves. GOD’s thoughts are
not as our thoughts. Take courage, my dear Mrs. _C――――_; _Bethesda_’s
welfare doth not depend on a single person. GOD will provide: I think
he hath already. I care not if all the boarders were gone. Mr. _R――――_
and _D――――_ and you are hearty. Enough, enough! GOD will bless and
prosper you. I am more than contented. My blessing to all the children.
That the GOD of all grace and mercy may fill you with all his fulness,
is the earnest prayer of, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your very affectionate, sincere friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXLIII.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                             _London, July 10, 1756._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

YOUR letter gave me satisfaction. I read it on our Letter-day, and you
and the rest of my dear family had many prayers put up for you. May
they enter into the ears of the LORD of Sabaoth! Ere now, I hope you
have agreed upon what plan to act. I shall send no one over. As I would
have the family lessened as much as possible, you that are left upon
the spot will be sufficient. Debts may then be paid, and the plantation
brought into good order, by the time Providence opens a door for my
seeing _America_ again. What think you of _J―――― P――――_? If not truly
serious, I would not have him sent to the college. LORD JESUS, do
thou shew all concerned, what thou wouldst have them to do! Surely
_Bethesda_ will be a house of mercy still. GOD blesses my feeble
labours here. Last night I came from _Bristol_. There the word ran and
was glorified. In a few days I set out for _Scotland_. GOD continue my
moving life, till I am moved at last to glory! Continue to pray for me,
and assure yourself of not being forgotten by, my very dear Mr. _D――――_,

                    Yours most affectionately, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXLIV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, July 17, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind letter found me just returned from _Bristol_,
and just setting out for _Maidstone_ and _Chatham_, where I have been
to preach the gospel, and to visit a poor murderer. I hope that my
poor feeble labours were not altogether in vain in the LORD. A divine
influence accompanies the word preached here, and I am now preparing
for my northern expedition. If your Ladyship removes not from
_Donnington_ soon, perhaps I may have the honour of waiting upon your
Ladyship there. My motions must be very quick, because I would hasten
to _Scotland_ as fast as possible, to have more time at my return.
Eternity! eternity! O how do I long for thee! But alas, how often
must we be like pelicans in the wilderness, before we arrive there?
Solitariness prepares for the social life, and the social life for
solitariness again. Thus doth an all-wise Redeemer set one over against
another. JESUS is the alone center of peace and comfort in either
situation. Your Ladyship knows this by happy experience. Perhaps our
consolations come sweetest, when immediately derived from the fountain
head. Springs fail, the fountain never can nor will. That your Ladyship
may every moment be refreshed with its living waters, is and shall be
the earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCXLV.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                          _Islington, July 27, 1756._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

SINCE my last, which I believe is not yet gone, I have given an order
to have Mr. _R――――_’s children delivered to him or his mother, or
whomsoever they shall appoint: and pray lessen the family as much
as possible. I wish I had none in the house, but what were proper
_orphans_. The plantation would then suffice for its support, and
debts be paid: but we must buy our experience. Troubles seem to beset
us here: but we are all secure in GOD, even in a GOD in CHRIST. His
gospel flourishes in _London_. I am just returned from preaching it at
_Sheerness_, _Chatham_, and in the camp. This afternoon or to-morrow I
set off for _Scotland_. I can only add, that with continual prayers for
your temporal and spiritual welfare, I am, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ My hearty love to all. The LORD be with you! _Amen_, and
_Amen_!

                            _To Mr. Z――――._

                                       _Sunderland, August 14, 1756._

_Honoured and very dear Sir_,

HOW swiftly doth my precious time fly away! It is now a fortnight since
I came to _Leeds_ in _Yorkshire_, where the gospel had indeed free
course, did run, and was glorified. On the _Sunday_ evening, a few
hours after my arrival, many thousands were gathered in the fields, to
whom, I trust, JESUS enabled me to speak with some degree of power. The
following week I preached in and about _Leeds_, thrice almost every day,
to thronged and affected auditories; and on _Sunday_ last the fields
were indeed white ready unto harvest. At _Bradford_, about seven in the
morning, the auditory consisted of about ten thousand; at noon, and in
the evening at _Burstall_, to near double the number. Though hoarse,
the Redeemer helped me to speak, so that all heard. Upon every account
it was a high-day. In the evening several hundreds of us rode about
eight miles, singing and praising GOD. Indeed it was a night much to
be remembered. The next morning I took a sorrowful leave of _Leeds_,
preached at _Tadcaster_ at noon, and at _York_ the same night. GOD was
with us. On _Tuesday_ I preached twice at _York_ (delightful seasons!);
on _Wednesday_ at _Warstall_, about fifty miles off; on _Thursday_
twice at _Yarm_, and last night and this morning here. All the way I
have heard of a great concern since I was in these parts last year, and
of many glorious trophies of the power of redeeming love. In heaven,
honoured Sir, you will know all. There I shall throw my crown before
the Lamb, and there you shall be rewarded for strengthening the hands
of the most unworthy creature that ever was employed by GOD. After
spending my sabbath here, and visiting _Shields_, _Newcastle_, and
some adjacent places, I purpose to go on to _Scotland_. From thence
I hope to have the honour of writing to you again. This is the first
time I have had a proper opportunity of refreshing myself in that way.
Praying that you may increase with all the increase of GOD, and begging
your acceptance of repeated thanks for repeated unmerited favours, I
subscribe myself, honoured and very dear Sir,

              Your most dutiful, though most unworthy son
                        in the glorious gospel,

                                                              _G. W._

                                      _Edinburgh, September 9, 1756._

_My very dear Friend_,

GLAD, yea very glad should I have been to have waited upon you at
_C――――_. But it seems it was not to be. However, if I should return
from _Glasgow_, GOD willing, I shall call upon you; if not, in heaven,
in heaven we shall meet. GOD be with you and yours! I am just going off.
O these partings! they are cutting. I trust JESUS hath been walking
amidst the golden candlesticks. You will hear particulars from others.
I have only time to beg the continuance of your prayers, and with
hearty love to your yoke-fellow, Mr. _C――――_, and his spouse, to
subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXLVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                     _Edinburgh, September 21, 1756._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I THANK you most heartily for your kind letter, and for all other
tokens of your regard and love. I can only send you a pepper-corn of
acknowledgment. My Master, my long-suffering, ever-loving, ever-lovely
Master, will pay you all. I hope he hath directed my steps. On
_Saturday_ I received a message from our new Governor of _Georgia_,
desiring to see and converse with me, before he embarks. This could
not have been done, if I had went to _Ireland_ now. Our LORD orders
all things well. O remember me before his throne. To-morrow I leave
_Edinburgh_. Your letter shall be delivered to Mr. _R――――_. Be pleased
to give the inclosed to Mr. _Scot_, to put in his _Philadelphia-Packet_.
I am busy, and yet, alas! I do nothing. Impressions seem to be
promising here. LORD, what am I? less than the least of all, but for
CHRIST’s sake, my very dear friend,

                 Yours indissolubly in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXLIX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                          _London, October 27, 1756._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

HOPING that they would find your Ladyship at _Bristol_, I wrote a few
lines not long ago from _Leeds_. Since that I have been in honest Mr.
_G――――_ and Mr. _J――――_’s round, preaching upon the mountains to many
thousands. One that was awakened three years ago, is gone to heaven,
and desired to be buried upon the spot where she was awakened. The
sacrament at Mr. _G――――_’s was most awful, and the _Welch_ night at
_Leeds_ exceeding solemn. I would have continued my circuit, but found
that preaching so frequently in those cold countries, was bringing on
my last year’s disorder. Being therefore grown very prudent, I am come
to open our new chapel in _Tottenham-Court Road_, and in my poor way
to recommend the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. LORD, what am I, that
thou shouldest suffer me to put a pin in thy tabernacle! O for grace
to stand in a trying hour. Something very extraordinary lies before us:
“Prepare to meet thy GOD,” seems now to be the call to all. Blessed be
GOD, his Spirit hath not done striving for us. This, I hope, is a token
for good. Never did I know the fields more ready unto harvest, than
I have seen them in the North. May I wish your Ladyship joy of what
hath happened at the other end of the town. May his Lordship be made
a long and public blessing to this sinful nation! If the other elect
Ladies are all at _Clifton_ court, I wish you all the blessings of the
everlasting gospel. Though utterly unworthy of such an honour, offering
my poor pepper-corn of acknowledgment for all your Ladyship’s unmerited
kindnesses, I beg leave to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MCL.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                          _London, October 30, 1756._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I CAN only drop you a few lines. I am just returned from a thousand
miles northern circuit, and Mr. _Graham_ is just a going. All your
relations are well. The fields have been white ready unto harvest.
In about a week, a new building at the other end of the town is to be
opened. I expect to see your new Governor every moment. By his ship I
hope to send letters to you all. May GOD bless and prosper you! _J――――
H――――_’s relations are well. You will give him all the encouragement
you can. I am still for lessening the family as much as possible. My
wife wrote lately. I have scarce time to subscribe myself, dear Mrs.
_C――――_,

                 Your most affectionate, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLI.


                         _To Alderman H――――._

                                          _London, November 6, 1756._

_My dear Friend_,

I AM glad you got no more hurt by your late fall from your horse. May
the LORD JESUS write the laws of gratitude upon all our hearts! I wish
my brother’s sickness may be sanctified to his better part. I know not
the case of the poor weavers: I do not love to fish in troubled waters,
and yet I fear more and more troubles await us both at home and abroad.
O that the walls and street of the _New Jerusalem_, may be built in
troublesome times! He hath said it, who is also able to perform it. I
wish I may begin to begin to build in earnest. Do pray for me: I shall
never forget you or yours. May this find you on the full stretch for
JESUS! He was stretched upon the cross for you and me. Amazing love!
Adieu. I must away. Beg Mr. _B――――_ to write if my brother grows worse.
I will answer him as soon as possible; but whilst my cold continues,
I cannot expect to see you at _Gloucester_. O for a warm heaven! there
you will know how much I am, my very dear Friend,

                       Yours in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLII.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                         _London, November 12, 1756._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I HAVE just been with your new Governor, who sets out to-morrow. May
the LORD of all lords make him a blessing! Upon the receipt of this,
do you wait upon his Excellency, and give _Him, and whom he pleases to
bring with him_, an invitation to _Bethesda_. I know dear Mrs. _C――――_
will make proper provision. I have had no letters for a long season.
I have only time to inform you, that we have just opened a new chapel
at _Tottenham-Court Road_, and that I trust the Redeemer’s glory
filled it last _Sunday_. Have you persons enough to exercise before
the Governor? Can they receive him under arms? That the Captain of our
salvation may make them all good soldiers for himself, is the earnest
prayer of, my dear Mr. _D――――_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCLIII.


                            _To Lady ――――._

                                         _London, November 17, 1756._

_Honoured Madam_,

AS I thought it would give your Ladyship satisfaction, I herein
inclose the copies of two letters sent from the condemned youth, in
whose behalf your Ladyship hath interposed. May the Redeemer crown
your endeavours with success! Blessed be his name, we hear of daily
instances of his grace! At _Long-Acre_ indeed the word ran, and at
_Tottenham-Court_ chapel we have had some glorious earnests of future
blessings. Providence, I doubt not, will enable us to pray for it.
My constant work now is, preaching about fifteen times a week. This,
with a weak appetite, want of rest, and much care lying upon my mind,
enfeebles my too, too feeble nature. But the joy of the LORD is my
strength. And my greatest grief is, that I can do no more for Him, who
hath done and suffered so much for me. I thank your Ladyship for your
kind letter and good wishes. Indeed, honoured Madam, you are always
remembered at the throne of grace. That your Ladyship’s soul may always
prosper, and that you may increase with all the increase of GOD, is and
shall be the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLIV.


                           _To Mr. H――――y._

                                          _London, December 9, 1756._

_My very dear Friend_,

LAST night Mr. _M――――_ informed me, that Mr. _C――――_ shewed him a
pamphlet, wrote on purpose to prove the fundamental errors of my
printed sermons, and that you had offered to preface it, but he chose
you should not. That this is true, I as much believe, as that I am
now at _Rome_. But I wish that my very dear friend may not repent his
connection and correspondence with some, when it is too late. This is
my comfort, I have delivered my soul. Mr. _R――――_ hath been so kind
as to send me the two volumes of _Jenks’s Meditations_, and desires
me to annex my recommendation to yours. I have answered, that it will
not be prudent or beneficial to him so to do. I fear they are too large
to go off. I hope that my dear friend prospers both in soul and body.
Conviction and conversion work go on here. LORD keep us from tares!
All is well at _Clapham_; I have expounded there twice. GOD hath met us
at our new building. I know that you will pray, it may be full of new
creatures. My most cordial respects await your mother and sister; my
wife joins. With great haste, but much greater love, I subscribe myself,
my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLV.


                         _To Mr. Aaron B――――._

                                          _London, December 9, 1756._

_My very dear Friend_,

AS I am informed the _Philadelphia_ packet sails this day, I cannot
omit acknowledging the receipt of Mr. _P――――_’s paper: the duplicates
came to hand before. A memorial is drawn up by proper persons, and
application is to be made for a charter. As yet, every thing promises
well. This morning I am going to send _P――――_’s writing to those, who
I believe will put it into his Majesty’s hands. The letters mentioned
by Mr. _B――――_, about purchasing the land for the _Indians_, I did
not receive, but I shall take the hint in the last, and do what I can.
Alas! that is but little. Some books shall be secured for _John O――――_,
and some bibles, &c. for the _Indian_ school. I wish _John O――――_
of _Long-Island_ was here, especially if he can preach, and could be
spared from his mission for a few months, and his passage paid. I would
pay his passage back again, and I hope get something for that which you
have in view. At the ensuing fast, it practicable, I intend making a
collection. Night and day, our hands are lifted up for dear _America_.
I fear we are to be brought into far greater extremity, both at home
and abroad, ere deliverance comes. The LORD reigneth, and blessed be
the GOD of our salvation. I am sorry you have not your degree. It is
ready, if testimonials were sent from those that know you. This not
being done, it looks as though the character given you on this side the
water, was not justly founded. The LORD JESUS direct and bless you! I
wish you would write oftener. How glad would I be to see _America_, but
my way is hedged up. We have just opened a new chapel at the other end
of the town, and the awakening both in town and country continues. We
have many pleasing accounts from various quarters, and more ministers
are coming out to preach the gospel. This is refreshing. How does the
worthy Governor? I cannot write now, but I pray. Dear Captain _G――――_
is gone: O that my turn was come! JESUS is kind. I am strengthened to
preach fourteen times a week, and I trust it is not in vain. You have
work enough. That the giver of all strength may support and succeed you
more and more, is the earnest prayer of, dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLVI.


                           _To Mrs. G――――._

                                         _London, December 15, 1756._

_Dear Madam_,

WHAT a prayer-hearing, promise-keeping GOD do we serve! O that I had a
heart to bless and praise him! Your kind and opportune contribution for
the new chapel, strengthened my faith, and encouraged me (in spite of
the opposition of some narrow hearts) to go forwards with it, till it
is compleated. Surely the work is of GOD. Last _Sunday_ there was a
wonderful stirring amongst the dry bones; some great people came, and
begged they might have a constant seat. An earnest this, I believe, of
more good things to come. To me, dear Madam, it is the most promising
work the Redeemer ever vouchsafed to employ me in. LORD, what am I?
Help me, glorious _Emmanuel_, to abhor myself in dust and ashes! He
will bless you, dear Madam, for what you have done. O that I had a
thousand lives to employ in his service! I am much obliged to dear
Mrs. _B――――_. Neither she nor you will have reason to repent your zeal
on this occasion. It will be much for the Mediator’s glory, and the
welfare, I hope, of thousands of souls, to have every thing honourably
discharged. I know I shall have your prayers, dear Madam, and I am sure
you have mine. O that you may know in whom you have believed! Come,
dear Madam, be not discouraged; you know who hath said, “then shall
ye know, if ye follow on to know the LORD.” I could enlarge, but
it is near six in the morning, and I must away to preach. O that my
blessed Master may never turn me out of that divine employ! I hope my
most grateful respects and acknowledgments will find acceptance with
dear Mrs. _B――――_; and your acceptance of the same will add to the
obligations already laid on, dear Madam,

              Your most ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCLVII.


                           _To Mrs. B――――._

                                         _London, December 30, 1756._

_Dear Madam_,

GRATITUDE constrains me to send you a few lines. They inform you,
that GOD is doing wonders at the new chapel. Hundreds went away last
_Sunday_ morning that could not come in. On _Christmas-Day_, and last
_Tuesday_ night (the first time of burning candles) the power of the
LORD was present, both to wound and to heal. A neighbouring Doctor hath
baptized the place, calling it “_Whitefields’s Soul-trap_.”――Just now
the following letter came to hand.

_Reverend Sir_,

A THOUGHT came into my mind last _Sunday_ morning, to go to hear you at
the new tabernacle, and to see what sort of a place it was. In one part
of your discourse my heart trembled, and the terrors of the LORD came
upon me. I then concluded, that I must prepare for hell, and that there
was no hope of salvation for me. I take this method, being assured that
you will excuse the liberty I take to ask you one question, How I can
be convinced that my past sins are to be forgiven? And O, what must I
do to be saved! My sins are innumerable. GOD is just. I cannot think
that I have any interest in the Redeemer’s blood. My soul is full of
grief. I must conclude. Dear Sir, favour me with a line, which will be
greatly acknowledged by,

                             Your friend,

                                                              _A. B._

I have answered my new friend, and pray the friend of sinners to make
the chapel a _soul-trap_ indeed, to many wandering creatures. Abundance
round about, I hear are much struck. O for humility! O for gratitude!
O for faith! Wherefore should I doubt?――Surely JESUS will carry me
through, and help me to pay the workmen. Accept repeated thanks for
the help afforded by your dear Ladies, and depend on having the poor
prayers of, dear Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCLVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. M――――._

                                           _London, January 4, 1757._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

JUST now I received and read your kind letter, and hope, GOD willing,
on _Friday_, to have the pleasure of a personal interview. May our
common LORD sanctify it to our mutual edification! Glad should I have
been to have known you before. I love the _Hanoverians_, because I
think they love, and would prove faithful to our dear King _George_.
I am sorry for the treatment they have met with, but it is not our
province to meddle with politics. Blessed be GOD for a kingdom that is
not of this world, which can never be removed, or so much as shaken.

            Blest is faith that trusts CHRIST’s power,
            Blest are saints that wait his hour;
            Haste, great conqueror, bring it near;
            Let the glorious close appear.

You see, my dear Sir, how free I write. It is because I think you are
a true minister of our glorious _Emmanuel_. Be pleased to remember
me when near his throne. Though a stranger, you know my name: I am
the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints, but for
CHRIST’s sake, reverend and dear Sir,

              Your unworthy brother and fellow-labourer,
                        in our LORD’s vineyard,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCLIX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                          _London, January 12, 1757._

_Honoured Madam_,

WILL your Ladyship be pleased to accept a few hasty lines? They come
with hearty wishes, that your Ladyship, and every branch of your
honourable family, may have a very happy new year.――This can only be
had in JESUS, and therefore I wish, from the very bottom of my heart,
that you all may be blessed with all spiritual blessings.――These
are blessings indeed. They are solid, they are lasting, commensurate
even with eternity itself. I hope we have some daily foretastes
of this. Indeed, honoured Madam, a wide door seems to be opening at
_Tottenham-Court_ chapel. The word flies like lightning in it; O that
it may prove a _Bethel_, a house of GOD, a gate of heaven! I believe
it will.――As the awakening continues, I have some hopes that we are not
to be given up. Alas! alas! We are _testing_ and _contesting_, while
the nation is bleeding to death. We are condemning this and that; but
sin, the great mischief-maker, lies unmolested, or rather encouraged by
every contending party. Well, the LORD reigns;――and therefore blessed
be the GOD of our salvation.――I hope your honoured sister, and her
noble Lord, are well. I sometimes wish that his Lordship was at the
helm, but infinite wisdom knows what is best. Happy they who can look
beyond time! The christian can; the short-sighted infidel dares not,
cannot. But I grow troublesome. I must therefore only add my most
grateful acknowledgments, and assure your Ladyship, that I am, honoured
Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER ♦MCLX.


                        _To Lady M―――― H――――._

                                          _London, January 13, 1757_.

_Honoured Madam_,

I WISH your Ladyship joy. What a mercy, to be made an instrument in
settling a true minister of JESUS CHRIST! May he be the spiritual
father to many souls! Your Ladyship’s unexpected sight of your son, was
like life from the dead. What pleasure then must be the consequence of
seeing our relations brought home to GOD! This be your happy lot! The
holy spirit seems to be quickening many dead souls here. I am informed,
that all are alive without the _Cannon-Gate_; but such are dead whilst
they live. O _Scotland_! _Scotland_! Turn us, O good LORD, and so shall
we be turned! We had need to fast and pray too.――Your Ladyship, I doubt
not, mourns in secret. The glorious _Emmanuel_ will put your tears into
his bottle. That your consolations in him may abound evermore, is the
earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I THANK you heartily for your last kind letter, and for all your works
of faith and labours of love.――Glad would I be to see _America_, but
the cloud doth not seem to move that way as yet.――The new chapel at the
other end of the town is made a _Bethel_, and the awakening increases
day by day. O that it was so at _Georgia_! Surely the great Shepherd
and Bishop of souls will bless you, for taking care of the lambs
in that distant wilderness.――Mr. _P――――_’s leaving _Bethesda_ sadly
distresses me; but my eyes are upon Him who knows all. I wrote to
desire Mr. _P――――_ to continue the oversight of my affairs, till I
can come myself. Whatever he and you shall agree to, in respect to
Mr. _R――――_, &c. I shall acquiesce in: only I desire that all who are
capable may be put out, and the family reduced as low as possible,
till the war is over, and the institution out of debt. I find nobody
mentions _I―――― P――――s_. If _I―――― P――――m_ goes to the college, cannot
he and Mr. _D――――_ be enough for the school? Ere now, _G―――― W――――_ I
hope is put out.――LORD, remember me and all my various concerns!――GOD
bless and direct you in every step! He will,――he will.――I trust you
will find it so in your late determination? Now you are free. Things
that seem against us at first, afterwards prove to be designed for
us.――What is to become or us here, GOD only knows.――A year perhaps may
determine.――The best sign is, that the awakening continues.――A parcel
of the addresses was put up for you, but through mistake not put into
the box. All your relations are well. That you may prosper both in body
and soul, and be filled with all the fulness of GOD, is the earnest
prayer of, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter lies before me, for which, be pleased to accept my
cordial thanks. I am glad you got safe to _Chatham_, and heartily
pray, that the GOD of the sea, and the GOD of the dry land, may be your
convoy on the mighty waters. The continuance of your correspondence
will be quite agreeable. Who knows but JESUS may bless it to our mutual
edification? I want to be stirred up, to begin to begin to do something
for him, who hath done and suffered so much for ill and hell-deserving
me. Surely, I am a worthless worm, and therefore little moved with
whatever judgment an ill-natured, misinformed world may form of me.
The great day will discover all. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly.――O
to be an _Israelite_ indeed, in whom there is no guile! Simplicity
and godly sincerity is all in all. A want of this, I fear, hath led
the Count into all his mistakes. With great regret I speak or write
of any people’s weaknesses; but I did and do now think, that divine
Providence called me to publish what you mention. The Redeemer gave
it his blessing. I do not find that their fopperies are continued,
and I hear also that they have discharged many debts. You seem to have
right notions of the sermon to which you refer. It certainly speaks of
a sinless state, which is not attainable in this life. We are called
to be saints, but not angels. Strange, that after so many years, such
an error should be propagated!――but so it is. LORD, what is man? Glory
be to GOD, there is a time coming, when sin, root and branch, shall
be destroyed: I mean at death. Then an eternal stop will be put to the
fountain of corruption, and we shall be sinless indeed.――Till then, O
JESUS, do thou continue to wash us in thy blood, and cloathe us with
thy compleat and everlasting righteousness; and at the same time, out
of a principle of love to thee, do thou help us to follow hard after
that holiness, without which no man can see the LORD!――But whither am
I going? My very dear Sir, excuse prolixity. I write to you, as to one
whom I love in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. My most cordial respects
await all that love him. My wife joins in sending you the same, with,
reverend and very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

A FEW days ago, I received the kind benefaction for the happy convicts.
Not doubting of success, I had advanced some guineas, which with what
hath been procured from other hands, hath bought both their liberties,
and they are provided for on the other side of the water; just now I
believe they are under sail. O that he, who I suppose will now receive
a pardon, was alike favoured! But not many mighty, not many noble are
called. However, some come to hear at _Tottenham-Court_. _S――――_ the
player, makes always one of the auditory, and, as I hear, is much
impressed, and brings others with him. I hope this will not find your
Ladyship ill of the gout. May the LORD JESUS bear all your sickness,
and heal all your infirmities both of body and soul! I am sensibly
touched when any thing affects your Ladyship; gratitude constrains to
this. What shall I render unto the LORD for all his mercies? I would
preach for him, if I could, a hundred times a day. Surely, such a
worthless worm was never honoured to speak for the Redeemer before.
Your Ladyship will excuse; I must away, and give a little vent to the
heart of, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

PROVIDENTIALLY, a Lady was at my house when the bearer brought your
letter, who perhaps may want just such a servant, within the time
mentioned. Thus GOD provides for those that love him. He is indeed a
prayer-hearing, a promise-keeping GOD. Satan may and will have us, that
he may sift us as wheat; but JESUS prays for us; our faith therefore
shall not fail. This is my support; this, my very dear Sir, must be
yours. Ere long we shall be tempted no more. I am a poor soldier; I
want to be discharged. Not from CHRIST’s service, but from this prison
of the flesh. O that I could do something for JESUS whilst here below!
my obligations increase. He vouchsafes daily (O amazing love) to own my
feeble labours. The word runs and is glorified. That it may run and be
glorified more and more, under GOD, through your instrumentality, is
the earnest prayer of, reverend and very dear Sir,

                Your affectionate but unworthy brother,
                         in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

_My Lord_,

I MAKE bold to trouble your Lordship with the proposals about the
_Georgia_ college; they should have been sent before, but I heard that
your Lordship was out of town. On _Monday_ next, my business calls me
into the country. If your Lordship should have leisure immediately to
run over the memorial, I would call on _Saturday_ morning to know your
Lordship’s mind. In the mean while, praying that your Lordship may be a
lasting blessing to your country, I subscribe myself,

         Your Lordship’s most dutiful, obliged humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._

CANNOT you come here for one day this week? I shall leave _Edinburgh_
on _Monday_, GOD willing.――Attendance upon the assembly, and preaching,
have engrossed all my time. I can scarce send you this.――_Nil mihi
rescribas attamen ipse veni._――Adieu! With love more than I express, I
am, my dear Mr. _T――――_,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ JESUS is good to us. My hearty love awaits your whole self and
family.――It is near eight at night.

                                             _Glasgow, June 9, 1757._

_My very dear Friend_,

TO me, it is almost an age since I wrote to you last. But at
_Edinburgh_ I was so taken up all day, and kept up so late at night,
that writing was almost impracticable. Surely my going thither was
of GOD. I came thither the twelfth of _May_, and left it the sixth of
_June_, and preached just fifty times. To what purpose, the great day
will discover. I have reason to believe to very good purpose. Being
the time of the general assembly (at which I was much pleased) many
ministers attended, perhaps a hundred at a time. Thereby prejudices
were removed, and many of their hearts were deeply impressed.
About thirty of them, as a token of respect, invited me to a public
entertainment. The Lord High Commissioner also invited me to his table,
and many persons of credit and religion did the same in a public manner.
Thousands and thousands, among whom were a great many of the best rank,
daily attended on the word preached, and the longer I staid, the more
the congregations and divine influence increased. Twice I preached in
my way to _Glasgow_, and last night opened my campaign here. The cloud
seems to move towards _Ireland_. How the Redeemer vouchsafes to deal
with me there, you shall know hereafter. In the mean while, my very
dear friend, let me entreat the continuance of your prayers. For I am
less than the least of all saints, and unworthy to be employed in the
service of so divine a Master. LORD JESUS,

                If thou excuse, then work thy will,
                By so unfit an instrument;
                It will at once thy goodness shew,
                And prove thy power omnipotent.

I hope this will find you, and your dear yoke-fellow and daughter,
enjoying thriving souls in healthy bodies. I doubt not but you are
brightening your crown, and increasing your reward, by doing good for
your blessed Master. Ere long, you shall hear him say “Well done.” That
will crown all. I can no more, I must away to my throne. My very dear
Sir, be pleased to accept ten thousand thanks for all favours, and give
me leave (after sending most cordial respects to dear Mrs. _S――――_ and
Miss) to subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
                 very ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Dublin, June 30, 1757._

_My very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter, dated the 25th instant, I just now received, for
which as well as all other favours be pleased to accept unfeigned
thanks.――What to do I cannot well tell.――As I am in the kingdom,
it is pity to leave it unvisited.――The door is open, and indeed
the poor Methodists want help.――Here in _Dublin_ the congregations
are very large, and very much impressed. The Redeemer vouchsafes to
give me great freedom in preaching, and arrows of conviction fly and
fasten.――One of the Bishops told a nobleman, “He was glad I was come
to rouse the people”――The nobleman, with whom I sweetly conversed
yesterday, told me this again.――LORD JESUS, do thou (for it is thy
doing) rouse all ranks for thy mercy’s sake! I hope Mr. _M――――n_ will
go on and prosper.――As for Mr. _J――――s_, I think it best for him to
keep as he is.――I find he is unsettled, and therefore would be always
uneasy.――If Messrs. _D――――s_ and _D――――r_ can serve alternately in the
Summer, by the help of JESUS I will go through the Winter work.――Alas,
that so few have the ambition of coming out to the help of the LORD
against the mighty. Not one clergyman in all _Ireland_ yet stirred up
to come out _singularly_ for GOD! Pity, LORD, for thy mercy’s sake!
I think GOD will yet appear for the protestant interest.――My rout
now is to _Athlone_, _Limerick_, _Cork_, and to return here about
_July 21_.――Whether I shall then go to the North, and to _Scotland_,
or whether I shall come by way of _Park-Gate_, must be determined
hereafter.――I know you will pray, my very dear Sir, that the
never-failing JESUS will direct my goings in his way. I would fain be
where and what he would have me to be.――I bless him, for making you,
my very dear Sir, instrumental in strengthening my weak hands, and
earnestly pray, that great may be the reward of you and your dear
relations in the kingdom of heaven.――Assure yourselves you or they are
never forgotten by, my very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _Dublin, July 3, 1757._

_My very dear Mr. K――――_,

ACCEPT a few lines from a poor, feeble, but willing pilgrim.――They
bring you most amazing news. The infinitely condescending JESUS
still vouchsafes to follow the chief of sinners with his unmerited
blessing.――In _Scotland_, his almighty arm was most powerfully
revealed;――and, here in _Dublin_, many have begun to say, “What shall
we do to be saved.”――Congregations are large, and very much impressed
indeed.――A spirit of conviction and consolation seems to be sent
forth.――All sorts attend, and all sorts seem to be affected.――I should
be glad to come to _London_, but cannot in confidence as yet.――Not
one minister either in the church or among the dissenters in this
kingdom, as far as I can hear, appears boldly for GOD, even a GOD
in CHRIST. To-morrow therefore I purpose to set out for _Athlone_,
_Limerick_, and _Cork_. GOD only knows, after that, where will be the
next remove.――Perhaps to _London_, perhaps to the North of _Ireland_,
which I hear lies open for the gospel.――_Winter_ must be the _London_
harvest.――O for more labourers who will account the work itself the
best wages! GOD will bless you and yours, for strengthening my hands. I
send you and Mrs. _K――――n_ my hearty love, and earnestly pray the LORD
of all Lords to bless you. Next post, or soon after in my circuit, I
hope to write to dear Mr. and Mrs. _J――――_. GOD forbid that I should
forget my old friends.――I pray for, though I cannot write to them.――I
am glad to find that dear Mr. _G――――_ is safe returned.――Pray remember
me to him, and to all enquiring friends in the kindest manner, and
assure them of being remembered at the throne of grace, by, very dear
Mr. and Mrs. _K――――_,

              Your most obliged, affectionate friend, and
                   ready servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

Since writing the above, I have been in the wars.――But blessed be GOD
am pretty well recovered, and going on my way rejoicing.――Pray hard.

                                              _Dublin, July 9, 1757._

_My dear Friend_,

MANY attacks have I had from Satan’s children, but yesterday, you
would have thought he had been permitted to have given me an effectual
parting blow. You have heard of my being in _Ireland_, and of my
preaching daily to large and very affected auditories, in Mr. _W――――_’s
spacious room. When here last, I preached in a more confined place in
the week days, and once or twice ventured out to _Oxminton-Green_, a
large place like _Moorfields_, situated very near the barracks, where
the _Ormond and Liberty_, that is, _high and low party boys_, generally
assemble every _Sunday_, to fight with each other. The congregations
then were very numerous, the word seemed to come with power; and no
noise or disturbance ensued. This encouraged me to give notice, that
I would preach there again last _Sunday_ afternoon. I went through the
barracks, the door of which opens into the green, and pitched my tent
near the barrack walls, not doubting of the protection, or at least
interposition of the officers and soldiery, if there should be occasion.
But how vain is the help of man! Vast was the multitude that attended;
we sang, prayed, and preached, without much molestation; only now and
then a few stones and clods of dirt were thrown at me. It being war
time, as is my usual practice, I exhorted my hearers not only to fear
GOD, but to honour the best of kings, and after sermon I prayed for
success to the _Prusian arms_. All being over, I thought to return home
the way I came; but to my great surprize access was denied, so that
I had to go near half a mile from one end of the green to the other,
through hundreds and hundreds of papists, &c. Finding me unattended,
(for a soldier and four methodist preachers, who came with me, had
forsook me and fled) I was left to their mercy; but their mercy, as you
may easily guess, was perfect cruelty. Vollies of hard stones came from
all quarters, and every step I took, a fresh stone struck, and made
me reel backwards and forwards, till I was almost breathless, and all
over a gore of blood. My strong beaver hat served me as it were for a
scull cap for a while; but at last that was knocked off, and my head
left quite defenceless. I received many blows and wounds; one was
particularly large and near my temples. I thought of _Stephen_, and as
I believed that I received more blows, I was in great hopes that like
him I should be dispatched, and go off in this bloody triumph to the
immediate presence of my master. But providentially, a minister’s house
lay next door to the green; with great difficulty I staggered to the
door, which was kindly opened to, and shut upon me. Some of the mob
in the mean time having broke part of the boards of the pulpit into
large splinters, they beat and wounded my servant grievously in his
head and arms, and then came and drove him from the door. For a while
I continued speechless, panting for and expelling every breath to be my
last; two or three of the hearers, my friends, by some means or other
got admission, and kindly with weeping eyes washed my bloody wounds,
and gave me something to smell to and to drink. I gradually revived,
but soon found the lady of the house desired my absence, for fear
the house should be pulled down. What to do, I knew not, being near
two miles from Mr. _W――――_’s place; some advised one thing, and some
another. At length, a carpenter, one of the friends that came in,
offered me his wig and coat, that I might go off in disguise. I
accepted of, and put them on, but was soon ashamed of not trusting my
master to secure me in my proper habit, and threw them off with disdain.
I determined to go out (since I found my presence was so troublesome)
in my proper habit; immediately deliverance came. A methodist preacher,
with two friends, brought a coach; I leaped into it, and rid in gospel
triumph through the oaths, curses, and imprecations of whole streets
of papists unhurt, though threatened every step of the ground. None
but those who were spectators of the scene, can form an idea of the
affection with which I was received by the weeping, mourning, but now
joyful methodists. A christian surgeon was ready to dress our wounds,
which being done, I went into the preaching place, and after giving
a word of exhortation, join’d in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving,
to him who makes our extremity his opportunity, who stills the noise
of the waves, and the madness of the most malignant people. The next
morning I set out for port _Arlington_, and left my persecutors to his
mercy, who out of persecutors hath often made preachers. That I may be
thus revenged of them, is the hearty prayer of,

                              Yours, &c.

_My very dear Mr. I――――_,

ACCEPT a few loving lines, as a token that you and yours are not
entirely forgotten by me. They leave me, earnestly desirous to know
what path the GOD whom I serve would have me to take. Every where
(O amazing condescension!) the glorious _Emmanuel_ so smiles upon
my feeble labours, that it is hard to get off. At _Port Arlington_,
_Athlone_, _Limerick_, and in this place, the word hath run and been
glorified. Arrows of conviction seem to fly, and the cup of many hath
been made to run over. I hope you have had some refreshings from the
presence of the LORD. Nothing else can carry us comfortably through
the howling wilderness of this troublesome life. I have met with some
hard blows from the _Dublin_ rabble. But blessed be GOD, they have
not destroyed me. Perhaps I am to see _London_ before my great change
comes. And who knows, but we may enjoy our _Peniels_ and _Bethels_
there again? Troublous times seem to be approaching. GOD hide us all
under the shadow of his almighty wings! When you see dear Mr. _W――――_,
pray remember me to him and his in the kindest manner, as likewise to
Mr. and Mrs. _W――――_. I think of, and pray for you, and all my dear
friends, though preaching and travelling prevents my writing. O that
none of us may be parted in another world! JESUS alone can keep us by
his almighty power. To his tender and never-failing mercy do I most
earnestly commit you, and earnestly intreat the continuance of your
prayers in behalf of, my very dear friend,

_Reverend and very dear Sir,_

THOUGH Mr. _Hopper_ promised to write you an ♦historical, letter as
last _Thursday_ from _Dublin_, yet I cannot help dropping you a few
lines from this place. Blessed be GOD, we had a passage, and last
night we had a pleasant season. At _Athlone_, _Limerick_, _Cork_,
and especially at _Dublin_, where I preached near fifty times, we had
_Cambuslang_ seasons. With the utmost difficulty I came away. O these
partings! The blows I received some time ago, were like to send me,
where all partings would have been over. But I find we are immortal
till our work is done. LORD JESUS, help me to begin in earnest! My
cordial love awaits my host and hostess. Be pleased to desire them to
send my things by the first opportunity, directed to Mr. _David Brown_,
at the Orphan-hospital, _Edinburgh_.――This morning our LORD hath met
us.――I am to preach twice more.――Ere long we shall praise for ever. I
hope dear Mr. _N――――_’s son is better. I commend your whole self, and
all dear friends, to his never-failing mercy, and entreat you never to
forget, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _London, August 26, 1757._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I THINK myself quite happy, in finding that you are satisfied in your
present situation.――I have no doubt of your being called to do it by
_Bethesda_’s GOD, and heartily pray that you may be amply rewarded by
Him.――I had rather have you preside over the orphan family, than any
woman I know of in the world. I would gladly indulge Mr. _B――――_, but
though I have sent again and again, I cannot find that his wife hath
the least inclination to come over; as this is the case, and she is
provided for, I wish he could be easy. Mr. _P――――_ and you may agree,
as to the terms of his continuance at _Bethesda_. Mr. _D――――_ seems
fixed, and I have written to Mr. _P――――_, to let _John H――――y_ have
overseers wages for the two last years, and find himself; but perhaps
it may be best not to give up the indentures.――As he is faithful, and
the plantation flourishes, I would not part with him. I do not love
changes. Sometimes I wish for wings to fly over; but providence detains
me here. I fear a dreadful storm is at hand. LORD JESUS, be thou our
refuge! At _Dublin_ I was like to be sent beyond the reach of storms.
But I find we are immortal till our work is done. A most blessed
influence attended the word in various parts of _Ireland_, and here
at _London_ the prospect is more and more promising. We expect some
important news from _America_. As to outward things, all is gloomy.
JESUS can dispel every cloud. I hope _Bethesda_ will be kept in peace.
I am glad the Governor hath been to visit the house. May GOD make him
a blessing to the colony! My kinsman hath met with an early trial. May
the LORD sanctify it! I am glad _G―――― W――――_ is put out, and that you
have sent the children; I pity them, but they must blame their parents.
O ingratitude! I wish you would now and then mention _B―――― W――――_, and
let me know how the _English_ children are disposed of. I would fain
have a list of black and white from time to time. Blessed be GOD for
the increase of the negroes. I intirely approve of reducing the number
of orphans as low as possible; and I am determined to take in no more
than the plantation will maintain, till I can buy more negroes. Never
was I so well satisfied with my assistants as now. GOD bless you! GOD
bless you! My tender love and respects attend you all. I would have
_Joseph P――――n_ sent to the college. I am glad Mrs. _F――――_ is married.
Continue to pray for me, and depend on hearing as often as possible
from, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

                Your affectionate, obliged friend, and
                   ready servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

JUST this moment I had the pleasure of receiving your very kind
letter, and have but just time, before the post goes out, to return
you my most hearty thanks. Blessed be GOD, I can send you good news
from _Plymouth_.――The scene was like that of _Bristol_; only more
extraordinary, to see officers, ♦soldiers, sailors, and the dock-men,
attending with the utmost solemnity upon the word preached. Arrows
of conviction fled and fastened, and I left all GOD’s people upon the
wing for heaven. Blessed be the LORD JESUS for ordering me the lot of
a _cast-out_!

                For this let men revile my name,
                I’d shun no cross, I’d fear no shame;
                All hail reproach!

I am glad that Mr. _M――――n_ and _V――――n_ returned safe. May an
effectual door be opened for both! If so, they will have many
adversaries. Will my dear Mr. _H――――_ tell Mr. _P――――_, that I expect
every thing to be compleated by the first _Sunday_ in _October_?
If the weather should alter I may be in town; if not, I may range
further.――This spiritual hunting is delightful sport, when the heart is
in the work. I expect to hear of a blacker cloud in _America_, but I am
glad the expedition was diverted. Our enemies may triumph for a while;
CHRIST can soon put a hook in the leviathan’s jaws.

                Thoughts are vain against the LORD,
                All subserves his sov’reign word;
                Wheels encircling wheels must run,
                Each in course to bring it on.

Happy for you, my dear Sir, that have fled to this GOD for refuge.
The more you know of Him, the more vilely you will think of yourself.
GOD bless you and your dear relations. I must conclude, or the
letter cannot go. In great haste, but far greater love and respect,
I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Mr. K――――n_,

HAD you encouragement enough last journey, to induce you and yours to
take another trip? My wife informs me so; she hath the rout. I expect
a line from her at _Gloucester_, to inform me of your determination.
Whatever it be, may it be for the glory of our common LORD! I hope some
souls that before were strangers to him, have begun to know him since
we parted last. We have had pleasant seasons. LORD, what am I! GOD
give us a warm winter! O how soon does the summer fly away! LORD JESUS,
pardon and quicken me, for thy mercy’s sake! Adieu. I must away. My
hearty love awaits your whole self, and all enquiring friends. In great
haste, I subscribe myself, my very dear Mr. _K――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I THANK you for your sympathizing letter sent to _Ireland_. The friend
of sinners stood by me, or I had been stoned to death. They were
thrown at me, not for speaking against the Papists in particular, but
for exciting all ranks to be faithful to King JESUS, and to our dear
sovereign King _George_, for his great name’s sake. LORD, what am I,
that I should be honoured to suffer any degree of pain or shame in
such a cause? Time will not permit me to descend to more particulars.
A young man, who will bring you soon a few lines from me, can tell you
the whole affair. He is a Methodist, and is coming from _Dublin_,
(and from a Bishop’s family) to study at _Glasgow_. I know you will
receive him gladly. O that GOD may qualify, and send forth thousands
to blow the trumpet in _Zion_! Seven gospel ministers were together at
_Bristol_, when the counsellor preached. A lawyer hath lately entered
likewise into orders, and I humbly hope the blessed JESUS will not give
us up. Both at home and abroad we are in great danger. But the LORD
lives, and will live and reign for ever. The awakenings in _New-Jersey_,
&c. are tokens for good. LORD, prepare us for whatever thou hast
prepared for us! We have had blessed seasons for these six weeks
last past, at _Plymouth_, _Exeter_, _Bristol_, _Gloucester_, and
_Gloucestershire_. This comes from my winter quarters. You will pray,
that JESUS may be with us. My most cordial respects and thanks await
your whole self, and all dear friends who are so kind as to enquire
after, my very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I BURNT, but I believe I shall never forget the contents of, your
Ladyship’s letter. Who but the Redeemer himself, can possibly describe
the yearnings of such a tender parent’s heart? Surely your Ladyship is
called to cut off a right hand, and pluck out a right eye; “But it is
the LORD, let him do what seemeth him good,” This was the language of
_Eli_, whose sons were sinners before the LORD exceedingly. This hath
often been the case of the best of people, and the greatest favourites
of heaven; but none knows the bitterness of such a cup, but those who
are called to drink it. If not sweetened with a sense of the love and
mercy of GOD in CHRIST, who could abide it? O what physic, what strong
physic do our strong affections oblige our heavenly Father to give us!
What pruning knives do these luxuriant branches require, in order to
preserve the fruit and delicacy of the vine. Blessed be GOD, there
is a time coming, when these mysterious dignified providences shall
be explained. I am glad Mr. _L――――_ is with your Ladyship: he has
a friendly heart. May the LORD JESUS raise up your Ladyship many
comforters! Above all, may he come himself. He will, he will. Mr.
_H――――_ ask’d most kindly after your Ladyship. On _Thursday_ Sir
_John M――――_, I am told, was at chapel, and many others. The prospect
brightens at that end of the town. O for warm winter quarters! O that
I could bear part of your Ladyship’s heavy load! But I can only in
my feeble way bear it on my heart, before him who came to heal our
sicknesses and bear our infirmities. That your Ladyship may come out
of these fiery trials, purged and purified like the brightest gold, is
the earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, sympathizing,
               and very ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, October 25, 1757._

_My dear Mrs. C――――_,

I FIND by your last to your brother _James_, that you was in jeopardy.
But I trust He that once drove away the _Spaniards_, will also preserve
you and the rest of my dear family from a French invasion. GOD give you
strength and courage! He will. Every thing seems to be in a critical
situation. GOD knows the event.

            Blest is faith that trusts CHRIST’s pow’r,
            Blest are saints that wait His hour.

In the midst of all, the work goes on here. In _Dublin_ I was like to
be stoned to heaven: but I am on earth yet. We had glorious seasons
both in _Scotland_ and _Ireland_. O that the cloud pointed to
_America_! But the Redeemer’s time is the best. He will bless you for
taking care of his family in the wilderness. I wish it had been reduced
more by the dismission of the _R――――s_ and _B――――l_. But perhaps GOD
may over rule all for the childrens future good. I hear that _R――――_
is in a _French_ prison; GOD give to him and his true repentance! They
have acted an ungrateful part; but thus our LORD was used; and the
servant must be as his LORD. The judgment-day will clear all. I wish
Mr. _B――――_ may be easy where he is. Mr. _P――――_ may agree upon terms
with him, and with _I―――― H――――_. I love old friends and servants, and
desire to bless GOD that my family hath got such a governess. Pray let
me know if you want any apparel, &c. I shall be quite concerned if you
abridge yourself of any thing. I cannot reward you: but the GOD whom
I desire to serve, can and will. To his tender and never-failing mercy
do I most humbly commit you, and beg the continuance of your prayers in
behalf of, my dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most affectionate, and obliged friend,

_Honoured Sir_,

I AM glad to hear from my nephew and other hands, that your
Excellency’s administration is so universally approved of. I pray
GOD to make you a lasting blessing to that colony, which hath long
wanted the blessing of an active, skilful and disinterested Governor.
I thank your Excellency for honouring _Bethesda_ with your company.
Lord _Hallifax_ informed me, that you would send him your sentiments
concerning its being enlarged into a college. I have drawn out
my proposals, and have delivered them to his Lordship; but the
uncertainty of the times prevents my pushing that affair. However,
_Georgia_’s welfare lies much on my heart; and it is my full design, if
providence should open a way, and I am assured of meeting with proper
encouragement, (which I make no doubt of) to serve that colony, and pay
it another visit. In the mean while, my heart’s desire and prayer to
GOD is and shall be, that you may have the honour and comfort of making
the people, over whom divine providence hath called you to preside,
happy and prosperous. I must not longer, dear Sir, detain you from
the public, and shall therefore only beg your acceptance of this, as
a token of respect, from, honoured Sir,

            Your Excellency’s most obliged humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, October 26, 1757._

_My dear Friend_,

I AM quite glad to hear, that you have met with encouragement to return
again to poor _Georgia_, and that my nephew serves under you. I humbly
hope that colony is not to be given over into the enemies hands; but
GOD only knows what is before us. The cloud at present looks black;
but it is always darkest before break of day. Our extremity may yet
be GOD’s opportunity to help and deliver us. In the midst of all, the
work of GOD goes on among us. At both ends of the town we have blessed
seasons. In _Scotland_ and _Ireland_ the word ran and was glorified.
Who knows but we may meet once more in _Georgia_. Blessed be GOD for a
well-grounded hope of meeting in heaven! My hearty love awaits all who
are travelling thither, and are so kind as to enquire after, my dear
friend,

                     Yours &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, November 3, 1757._

YOUR kind letter was very acceptable. Ere now, I trust, the Redeemer
hath given you the prospect of the barren wilderness being turned in
a fruitful field. Never fear; JESUS will delight to honour you. Every
clergyman’s name is Legion. Two more are lately ordained.

                Satan letts and men object,
                Yet the thing they thwart, effect.
                Thoughts are vain against the LORD,
                All subserves his standing word;
                Wheels encircling wheels must run,
                Each in course to bring it on.

You need not remind me of praying for the noble pair: surely they
are not to be prisoners another Winter. The kingdom of GOD suffereth
violence, and really if we would take it by force, we must do violence
to our softest passions, and be content to be esteemed unkind by those
whose idols we once were. This is hard work; but, Abba, Father, all
things are possible with thee! Blessed be GOD for putting it into your
heart to ask the pulpit for a week-day sermon. Are we not commanded to
be instant in season and out of season? If dear Mrs. _M――――_ will take
my word for it, I will be answerable for your health. The joy resulting
from doing good, will be a continual feast. GOD knows how long our
time of working may last. This order undoes us. As affairs now stand,
we must be disorderly or useless. O for more labourers. I am told
thousands went away last _Sunday_ evening from _Tottenham-Court_, for
want of room. Every day produces fresh accounts of good being done, and
at this end of the town the word runs and is glorified more and more.
Last _Friday_ we had a most solemn fast: I preached thrice; thousands
attended, and I humbly hope our prayers entered the ears of the LORD
of Sabaoth. More bad news from _America_ about our fleet: GOD humble
and reform us, for his infinite mercy’s sake! Go on, my dear Sir, and
tell a sinful nation, that sin and unbelief is the accursed thing which
prevents success. Thus at least we shall deliver our own souls, and
be free from the blood of all men. But I forget: I suppose you are
preparing for the pulpit: I dare not detain you. My best respects await
Mrs. _M――――_: your mother is well. That you may return to _London_ in
all the fulness of the blessings of the gospel of CHRIST, is and shall
be the prayer of, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. O――――_,

I THANK you very kindly for visiting _Bethesda_ family, and for
administering the Lord’s-supper. I am glad to hear that the Master
of the feast was present. Ere long I hope we shall be called to the
marriage-feast of the supper of the Lamb in heaven. GOD only knows
what awaits us in our journey thither. I hope poor _Georgia_ will be
preserved. I trust the LORD of all lords hath said, “Destroy it not,
for there is a blessing in it.” We are in equal jeopardy. JESUS is our
common refuge. Conviction and conversion work goes on amongst us. But I
long to see _America_ once more. O that I may never cease itinerating,
till I sit down in heaven. My hearty love awaits all that are bound
thither. Hoping ere long to hear good news from you and yours, I haste
to subscribe myself, my dear Mr. _O――――_,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I AM glad you have received my letter. I know not that I have one
of yours left unanswered. Blessed be GOD, for causing _Bethesda_ to
prosper. May it do so in every sense more and more! I hope you will
be preserved from the hands both of temporal and spiritual enemies.
GOD prepare us for all events! Pray let me know the names of all the
children. I wish they could be reduced this war time to the number of
fifteen; and I wish my nephew was not so hasty; and that the persons
you mention were (spiritually) shot through the heart. Many here seem
to be wounded in that manner. At _Tottenham-Court_ chapel, as well as
the Tabernacle, the word runs and is glorified. I am glad you have the
ordinance now and then. That the GOD of ordinances may bless you all
evermore, is the earnest prayer of, my dear Mr. _D――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Pray be particular in the account of the family. The LORD
JESUS smiles upon us here. He can, and I trust will preserve you from
_French_, _Spaniards_, and every hurtful foe. This is my constant
prayer.

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR letter to Mr. _D――――_ gave me great satisfaction. The contents,
no doubt, made angels to rejoice in heaven, and why not us embodied
spirits here on earth. So many called out of one family, is a peculiar
mercy. Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see, and
the ears that hear the things you hear. Grace, mercy, and peace be
multiplied upon you all! Who knows but we may see each other on this
side eternity? I am wishing every day for wings to fly to my dear
_America_ once more; but at present the way seems to be hedged up.
A fresh work is breaking out here, and the Redeemer seems to be
manifesting his glory in many souls. This, with what has been done
on your side the water, may give us some hopes, that though the enemy
may be permitted to break in like a flood, yet the Spirit of the LORD
will lift up a standard against him. The death of Governor _B――――_ and
President _Burr_, are dark providences: but JESUS lives and reigns. I
thank you and yours most heartily for your kind invitation: GOD willing,
I will accept it whenever I come over. LORD, hasten the time, if it be
thy blessed will! Be pleased to remember me in the kindest manner to
all enquiring friends. I entreat the continuance of your prayers in
behalf of, my dear Sir,

                       Yours in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

I AM a letter in your debt: I should be glad to answer your last in
person. The attraction towards _America_ is as strong as ever, but at
present I am stationed here. The word runs and is glorified. I fear the
deaths of the Governor and President will hurt _New-Jersey_ college:
but JESUS lives and reigns. When will my turn come to live and reign
with him for evermore! Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! If young _P――――_
should be sent from the Orphan-house to your college, be pleased to
furnish him with plain necessaries. I am informed he is a promising
youth. LORD, raise up _Elisha_’s in the room of ascended _Elijah_!
The residue of the Spirit is in his hands. The late effusion was
preparatory to your present trials. GOD make us ready for all events.
Excuse great haste; I write in greater love, as being, my dear friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

I AM very glad you have been so providentially detained at _Thetford_,
and that your bow abode in such full strength. The LORD help you to
give a good farewel stroke to-morrow! My poor feeble labours almost
brought me to the grave this last week; but preaching yesterday
three times on account of the _Prussians_ late success, hath somewhat
recovered me. It was a high day; thousands and thousands attended.
Where the carcase is, there the eagles will gather together. The chapel
is made a _Bethel_ indeed. I am glad you are coming to see. Spiritual
routs are blessed entertainments. I must prepare for my throne. It
is near five in the evening, and to-morrow I am to preach thrice. Mr.
_Jon――――_ said he would write this post. I was glad to hear by Mr.
_D――――_, that the noble pair were growing. That you all may increase
with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear
Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCLXXXVII.


                           _To Mrs. B――――._

                                         _London, December 14, 1757._

_Dear Madam_,

THE event only can prove, whether what I am going to mention, is of GOD.
Blessed be his holy name, by new-year’s day I hope we shall be able to
discharge our chapel debts. Every day proves more and more that it was
built for the glory of JESUS CHRIST, and the welfare of many precious
and immortal souls. But my attendance on that, and the Tabernacle too,
with a weak body, outward cares, and inward trials, have frequently
brought me of late to the apprehensions of being near my wished-for
port; but I am afraid I must keep out at sea some time longer. However,
I am brought to the short allowance of preaching but once a day, and
thrice on a _Sunday_. O that this feeble carcase could hold out more
for GOD! I want to begin to begin to do something for GOD. I shall be
glad if he is pleased to bring our present design to a prosperous issue.
You must know then, dear Madam, that round the chapel there is a most
beautiful spot of ground, and some good folks have purposed erecting
alms-houses on each side, for some godly widows. I have a plan for
twelve. The whole expence will be four hundred pounds: we have got
one hundred. The widows are to have half-a-crown a week. The sacrament
money, which will more than do, is to be devoted to this purpose. Thus
will many godly widows be provided for, and a standing monument left,
that the Methodists were not against good works. I beg you’ll mention
this to good Lady _C――――_ and Mrs. _G――――_; for I would not have it
public till the sum is raised, and we are sure of effecting the thing.
If I did not know, dear Madam, your benevolent, disinterested heart, I
should not thus make free. Be pleased to excuse, if you do not approve
the motion. I only mention it, because I believe such a thing would
much promote the glory of GOD. I leave this and all with him. I commit
you and good Lady _C――――_ to his protection, and beg a continued
remembrance in your prayers, in behalf of, dear Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, December 15, 1757._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

IF yet in this dying world, be pleased to accept a few grateful lines,
from one who highly esteems you for the sake of our common LORD.
Thousands can witness how often I have prayed for you in public, and
the great day will discover how earnestly your lingering case hath
been mentioned in my poor addresses to our GOD in private. Surely,
in a literal sense, reverend Sir, you are called to die daily. But
I trust and believe, the more the outward man decayeth, you will be
strengthened so much the more in the inward man. He that hath loved
you, will love you to the end; he that hath honoured you to be so
useful to church and state, will not leave you in the latter stages of
your road. A radiant crown awaits you. GOD, the righteous judge, will
give it you in that day. _O gloriam! quantum & qualem!_ O that I could
leap my seventy years. But I forget I am writing to a sick friend.
Pardon me, dear Sir, it being only a pepper-corn of acknowledgment for
all kind offices done in the behalf of, reverend and very dear Sir,

         Your most obliged, affectionate, sympathizing friend,
                  and ready servant in JESUS CHRIST,

                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I WISH your Ladyship joy of being for once so long alone: and why?
because I am persuaded your Ladyship is never less alone, than at
such seasons. Then the Father is in a particular manner with his dear
children: and though they seem in themselves to be like pelicans in the
wilderness, yet he is near at hand to hear their cry, and to bottle up
every tear: he that seeth in secret, will ere long reward your Ladyship
openly. O how are your Ladyship’s children indebted to you, for your
more than maternal tenderness! What a comfort is it, ever-honoured
Madam, that JESUS CHRIST is to come, and to be our judge! O that he
would come quickly! Why does he delay? I was near port, and am now put
out to sea again. O that it may be to pilot in some more dear souls!
The work seems but to be beginning. At _Tottenham-Court_ the word runs
and is glorified. By new-year’s day I hope the debt will be discharged.
Several have proposed building some alms-houses for godly widows,
on each side the chapel. I have a plan for twelve. The whole expence
will be four hundred pounds: we have got a prospect of two. I purpose
allowing each widow half-a-crown a week. The sacrament money will
more than do. The ground is most commodious, and near the high road.
If effected, I think it must bring glory to GOD, and be a standing
monument that we are not against good works. I only mention it to your
Ladyship. May that GOD, whom I desire to serve in the gospel of his
dear Son, direct and bless us in this and every thing we undertake for
his glory. But I fear I am detaining your Ladyship too long. O that I
could offer any thing adequate to your Ladyship’s repeated kindnesses
to such a worthless worm! My poor prayers and unfeigned sympathy, is
all the testimony I can give of my being, ever-honoured Madam,

              Your most dutiful, obliged, and very ready
               servant in our compassionate High-priest,

                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

HAVING lately heard of your Ladyship’s being returned to _Bath_, I
cannot help wishing your Ladyship joy of Sir _Charles_’s most agreeable
marriage. May your Ladyship’s present joy be consummated, in seeing
them and all your honourable relations sitting down together at the
marriage-feast of the supper of the Lamb. I have had frequent prospects
of this, since I saw your Ladyship. Often do I groan in this earthly
tabernacle. I long to be cloathed with my house from heaven. O that the
great GOD may vouchsafe to improve me, till he is pleased to call me
to my wished-for rest. Hitherto he owns my feeble labours. The work in
_London_ seems to be but as it were beginning. We live in troublesome
times; I trust the streets of the spiritual _Jerusalem_ will be built
in them. Happy they who have fled to JESUS CHRIST for refuge: they
have a peace that the world cannot give. O that the pleasure-taking,
trifling flatterer knew what it was! He would no longer feel such
an empty void, such a dreadful chasm in the heart which nothing but
the presence of GOD can fill. But I forget myself. I shall tire your
Ladyship; besides I must drop a few lines to good Lady _H――――n_; she
is in the furnace. When she is tried, her GOD will bring her forth like
gold. But I must detain your Ladyship no longer, than while I add my
dutiful respects to your Ladyship’s daughters, and beg your Ladyship’s
acceptance of the same from, honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR kind letter puzzles me. As the case is so very peculiar, I think
you cannot be too particular in writing down what you have been an eye
and ear witness to. I think that the calling some ministers together
for the ends proposed, is the best method that can be taken. Where two
or three are gathered together, and are agreed touching the thing they
shall ask, our LORD hath promised it shall be given to them. I shall
be glad to hear of their success. Ah, my dear man, little do we think,
when we first set out, what trials we shall meet with ere we arrive
at our journey’s end. I find more and more, that I am a mere novice in
the divine life, and have scarce begun to begin to learn my A B C in
the school of CHRIST. But by the grace of GOD I am what I am. He hath
helped out of six, and will also help out of seven troubles. I find you
have heard of the _Irish_ expedition. LORD, what am I, that I should
be counted worthy to suffer shame for thy great name’s sake! A more
effectual door than ever seems to be opening in this metropolis. A
counsellor, lately ordained, turns out a _Boanerges_. Thousands and
thousands flock to hear the everlasting gospel. The new chapel, where
I now write, turns out quite well. The LORD JESUS hath made it a gate
of heaven to many souls. This, with the signal deliverances lately
vouchsafed the protestant arms, makes me hope that our extremity will
yet be GOD’s opportunity to help and deliver us. Let us wrestle in
prayer for each other. O that the LORD may abundantly bless both you
and yours! Accept cordial love from me and mine. We are neither of us
likely to put into harbour yet. The voyage seems to me very long. But
I find we are immortal till our work is done. That we all may at last
enter port with a full gale, is the hearty prayer of, my very dear
friend,

      Yours most affectionately in our compassionate High-priest,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

I WISH you joy of the happy breach made in, or rather happy addition
made to your dear family. I thought I should never see it in the same
circumstances any more. You may chearfully let _Rebekah_ go. I trust
she hath met with an _Isaac_. May they love one another as CHRIST and
the church! The LORD now make you to laugh! I hope your latter end will
greatly increase. I send the surviving ones my most cordial love; and
praying that you may have more and more comfort in every one of them,
I subscribe myself, dear Madam,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Timothy_,

YOU will deliver the enclosed. I am glad to write a few lines on such
an occasion. GOD grant that the remaining dear single ones may be as
well disposed of! I bless the LORD that you are enabled to preach at
all. I often think of and sympathize with you. LORD, help me! What an
impatient creature should I be, was I to be visited in that manner! But
we know who hath promised, “that as our day is, so shall our strength
be.” Mrs. _Pearce_ is now out of the state of trial, and I am to bury
one of the same name next _Thursday_. Both, I believe, are gone to
heaven. LORD JESUS, when will my turn come? What can reconcile us to a
longer stay on earth, but the prospect of seeing his kingdom advanced?
It is very promising at _London_. Mr. _M――――n_ is a _Boanerges_. The
chapel is made a _Bethel_. Blessed be GOD, all is paid. I hope to
be with you in the Spring. Adieu. The LORD bless and comfort you! My
wife is poorly, but joins in hearty love to your whole self, and all
enquiring friends, with, my very dear man,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, February 3, 1758._

_Dear Madam_,

 I WAS glad, after
so long a silence, to receive a line from _Clifton_, where I find by
report there is like to be a total revolution. Your two worthy friends
I have neither seen nor heard from; and good Lady _H――――n_ I have not
visited, because I believe her Ladyship desired to be entirely private.
I suppose she will now be soon in town. GOD comfort her under all
her trials, and sanctify new creature-partings and disappointments to
your further proficiency, dear Madam, in the divine life. There is a
needs-be for all this. GOD help you to sing,

                          ―――――――― O happy rod,
                  That brought me nearer to my GOD.

I have been in hopes of being with him. But I cannot go, though at
present reduced to the short allowance of preaching once a day, except
thrice on a _Sunday_, At both ends of the town, the word runs and is
glorified. The champions in the church go on like sons of thunder. I
am to be at _Clapham_ this evening: Mr. _V――――_ will gladly embrace the
first opportunity. May it be a _Bethel_! _Bristol_, in all probability,
will be my first Spring excursion. O that I may begin to begin to
spring for my GOD! I beg, dear Madam, the continuance of your prayers,
as being, dear Madam,

              Your most obliged and ready servant in our
                         glorious High-priest,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, February 3, 1758._

_Dear Madam_,

I CANNOT help acquainting you and your honoured sister, and Mrs.
_G――――_, that the plan concerted some time ago is likely to be put
in execution. The trenches for the wall, I believe are begun, and
by the first of _May_, the houses are to be finished. If possible, I
would furnish them, that the poor might be sure of goods, as well as a
house. All things are possible with GOD. The thing hath scarce as yet
taken wind. Such secret expeditions, I trust, GOD will favour. Both
congregations and the divine influences increase. By thoughtfulness,
frequent preaching, and a crazy tabernacle, my nightly rests are
continually broken; but the joy of the LORD is my strength: and I hope
ere long to be where I shall keep awake for ever. I most earnestly beg
the continuance of your prayers, and you may be assured of being always
remembered in the poor addresses of, dear good Ladies,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter drove me to my knees, and as I do not hear of your
dear and honoured father’s release, I suppose he is yet detained a
prisoner. I shall make public and private mention of him, until I know
he is gone beyond the reach of prayer, and entered upon his eternal
work of praise. I pity the poor ministers, who will sorely miss him,
but shall rejoice in his entering into his Master’s joy. Once more
I send the good old saint my most cordial salutations and thanks
unfeigned. At the great day, before men and angels, I shall do it
openly. Then likewise, my dear Sir, I hope to see you and yours joining
in one universal uninterrupted hallelujah, and casting your crowns
before the throne of the glorious _Emmanuel_. In whose great name, with
most sincere condolence with Mrs. _S――――_ and all your afflicted family,
I once more beg leave to subscribe myself, reverend and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, March 5, 1758._

_Most reverend and dear Sir_,

THOUGH I am almost ashamed to put pen to paper, yet the kind mention
(as I hear from good Mr. _Z――――_) you have been pleased to make from
time to time of me, together with the importunities of that venerable
man of GOD, have at length prevailed upon me to trouble you with this
letter. O that an infinitely condescending Redeemer may excite you
thereby, most honoured Sir, to be instant in prayer for one who is
the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints. Long,
long before now did I think of entering into my wish’d-for rest. Times
without number hath this tabernacle groaned; but having obtained help
from GOD, I yet continue, in my poor way, to preach to all that are
willing to hear, the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. Through grace
the fields are as yet white, and as ready to harvest as ever. In the
Summer I range, and with a table for my pulpit, and the heavens for my
sounding-board, I am enabled generally thrice a day, to call to many
thousands to come to JESUS that they may have life. In the Winter I
am confined to this metropolis; but to my great mortification, through
continual vomiting, want of rest, and of appetite, I have been reduced
for some time to the short allowance of preaching only once a day,
except _Sundays_, when I generally preach thrice. Thousands attend
every evening at both ends of the town, and on Lord’s-days many, many
go away for want of room. The divine presence is apparently amongst
us, and every week produces fresh instances of the power of converting
grace. Blessed be GOD, we meet with no disturbances in town, and very
seldom in the country: but last year, while I was preaching in the
fields in _Ireland_, a popish mob was so incensed at my preaching the
LORD _our Righteousness_, and praying for our good old King, and the
King of _Prussia_, that they surrounded, stoned, and almost killed me.
But we are immortal till our work is done, and glad should I have been
to have died in such a cause. Mr. _W――――y_ hath societies in _Ireland_
and elsewhere; and though we differ a little in some principles,
yet brotherly love continues. I generally, when itinerating, preach
among his people, as freely as among those who are called our own. In
_London_ several new flaming preachers are come forth; and in various
parts of the kingdom we hear of divers others, who seem determined to
know and preach nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified. Thousands
and thousands are now praying daily for success to the _Prussian_ and
_Hanoverian_ arms. Your fast-days were kept here with great solemnity,
and will be so again, GOD willing, when I know the day. Our _Joshua_’s
are in the field. Many a _Moses_ is gone up into the mount to pray.
_Nil desperandum Christo duce, auspice Christo._ The ark trembles,
but underneath are the everlasting arms of an everlasting GOD. He that
wrought such wonders for the _Prussian_ monarch last year, can repeat
them this. LORD, we believe, help our unbelief! The distresses of
_German_ protestants, we look upon as our own. We have also endeavoured
to give thanks for the great mercy vouchsafed your Orphan-house, and
the protestant cause. LORD JESUS, repeat the occasions, for thine
infinite mercy’s sake! Pardon, pardon, most worthy Sir, the length of
this, and impute it to the encouragement given by the venerable Mr.
_Z――――_ to, most honoured Sir,

                     Your dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCXCVIII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                              _London, May 13, 1758._

_My very dear Mr. K――――_,

I HOPE this will find you rejoicing in success given to dear Mr.
_A――――_’s labours. If he is with you, be pleased to desire him to
prepare for coming to _London_ immediately after _Whitsuntide_. He
and dear Mr. _D――――_ may be in town whilst I take my _Welch_ and
West-country range. I am unaccountably detained here; but I trust
for good. The word seems to run and be glorified more and more. I am
somewhat surprised that I hear nothing from Mr. _P――――_, or my dear
Mr. _S――――d_: but all is well. My hearty love to him and all his dear
relations. Can you fix no time for coming up? I do not hear of the
cyder being arrived. When shall we be called to drink the new wine of
the kingdom? LORD, give me patience to wait! I am quite puzzled. Mr.
_P―――― W――――_, without sending me a line, is come to _Bristol_, and
proposes staying there some time. The consequence of his coming, is
division and uneasiness already. I care not to go and fish in troubled
waters: neither can I advise you so to do: and yet I believe your
going would be a very great blessing. I expect a line from Mr. _D――――_
every hour, who, I suppose, is upon the road to _London_. If not set
out, defer it for a few days, and you shall hear, GOD willing, more
particularly from, my very dear man, in great haste, but greater love,

               Yours, &c. &c. in our sympathizing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCXCIX.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                          _Gloucester, May 22, 1758._

_My very dear Sir_,

I HOPE you got to _London_ in great safety. Through divine goodness I
arrived at _Gloucester_ on _Saturday_ afternoon, and preached thrice
and gave the holy sacrament on _Sunday_. Thousands attended, and our
LORD gave us a blessed opening of the Summer campaign. I am now writing
in the room where I was born. Blessed be GOD, I know there is a place
where I was born again. That is my native city indeed. After finishing
this, I shall set out for _Bristol_, where I propose staying over
_Sunday_: then for _Wales_. My very dear Sir, add to my obligations,
by following me with your prayers. This tabernacle makes me to groan.
The one-horse chaise will not do for me. As it will not quarter I
am shaken to pieces. Driving likewise wearies me, and prevents my
reading; and if the road be bad, my servant that rides the fore-horse
is dirtied exceedingly. I have therefore sent to Mr. _S――――_’s about
the post-chaise, and desired him to beg the favour of you, my dear
Sir, to look at it, and let me know your thoughts. This is giving
fresh trouble: but you are my friend. May the friend of all richly
reward you for all labours of love. He will, he will.――You shall have a
hundred-fold in this life, and in the world to come, life everlasting.
Being about to set off, I can only add my due and most cordial respects
to all your dear relations and enquiring friends, and to beg the
continuance of all your prayers, in behalf of, my very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER MCC.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                             _Bristol, May 24, 1758._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

DO not take my seeming long silence ill. Indeed it was unavoidable.
Ever since the receipt of your kind letter, I have been so exceedingly
and yet I trust profitably busied at _London_, that till I left
it last week, I had not one moment to spare. However, your affair
was not quite neglected. I communicated it to the physician of the
_Foundling-Hospital_, who is my constant hearer, and he wrote me the
enclosed letter, and sent me also the enclosed paper. I heartily wish
your design may take effect at _Edinburgh_. Glad should I be to do
any thing in my power to promote it, but I have little expectation of
seeing _Scotland_ this year. The _English_ work is so extensive, and
the blessed prospect of abundant success at _London_, hath kept me so
long there, that I shall be much straitned in time;――but if friends
pray, who knows what may be done. LORD JESUS, direct my goings in thy
way! On _Sunday_ we opened the summer campaign in _Gloucestershire_.
Yesterday I came hither. In both places the fields are white ready unto
harvest. Fresh labourers are raised up in _Bedfordshire_. A flamer (a
learned clergyman) is broke forth, and almost a whole parish, (I think
in _Buckinghamshire_) is lately brought to enquire after JESUS. I know
you will say, may it spread far and near! I must conclude. Excuse my
not writing to all my dear, never to be forgotten friends, and beg them
to continue to pray for, dear Mr. _B――――_,

                         Theirs and yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCI.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                             _Bristol, May 26, 1758._

_My very dear Mr. K――――n_,

REPEATED acts of kindness and love, call for repeated acknowledgments.
――Accept therefore hearty thanks for your last _Salt-Hill_ favour, and
assure yourself, that neither this nor any former labour of love, will
be forgotten by Him, who takes notice of a cup of cold water given in
the name of a disciple. Through his divine goodness I got safe into
_Gloucestershire_, where I opened the summer campaign last _Sunday_.
Ever since _Tuesday_ evening, I have been preaching here twice daily.
Multitudes fly like doves to the windows. Abiding impressions seem to
be made.――This is the LORD’s doing: to Him be all the glory! On next
_Monday_, GOD willing, I set out for Wales. I know you will follow
me with your prayers. I am sure mine always attend you and yours: I
love such old steady friends. It is CHRIST-like, not to be given to
change.――Blessed be GOD for an unchangeable JESUS!

                To feel his power, to hear his voice,
                To taste his love, be all our choice!

I must away to my throne.――Adieu! The LORD be with you and yours! My
hearty love to Mr. _J――――_, and all who are so kind as to enquire after,
my very dear Mr. _K――――n_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCII.


                        _Bristol, May 28, 1758. Nine in the morning._

_My very dear Sir_,

I AM quite ashamed, that I should give you so much trouble:――but you
are my friend indeed. May the never-failing friend of sinners bless
and reward you a thousand fold! I have been just now preaching the
unsearchable riches of his grace, to a multitude of souls, in a fine
square.――Presently, at eleven o’clock, the blessed talk is to be
repeated at _Kingswood_, and then once more in the evening here.
Yesterday I went to _Bath_. But every thing wearies this shattered
bark. To-morrow, GOD willing, I go for _Wales_. The chaise must be my
carriage. I would part with that, and my other, and then if I could
have a good four wheel carriage for thirty or forty pounds, the expence
would not be so great. I would not lay out a single farthing but for
my blessed Master. Mr. _S――――_ is an honest friendly soul.――I leave
it entirely, my very dear Sir, to you and him. The LORD give you to
ride daily on in the chariot of his love. I return cordial thanks
to your mother and sisters for their concern for unworthy me.――Mrs.
_G――――_ and _B――――_ long to see them. I had a good season of christian
conversation at _Bath_, and found Sir _C―――― H――――m_ really converted
unto GOD.――I doubt not but dear Mr. _D――――s_ will enjoy much of his
blessed presence.――Be pleased to present my hearty love to him, and all,
and accept the same for yourself and family, from, my very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCIII.


                         _To Countess D――――._

                                            _Bristol, June 16, 1758._

_Honoured Madam_,

FOR this fortnight past, I expected never to have wrote to, or seen
your Ladyship, till I saw you sitting at CHRIST’s right hand. Never
was I brought so low as on my late _Welch_ circuit. But as far as I can
hear, it was one of the most prosperous I ever took. Twice every day,
thousands and thousands attended in various towns in _South-Wales_,
and on the _Sundays_ the numbers were incredible. Surely they fled
like doves to the windows. Welcome, thrice welcome death in such a
cause! Here, and in _Gloucestershire_, like scenes were opened. Blessed
expeditions these. I hope expeditions of another nature will not be
the worse for the prayers put up on such occasions. They must and
will enter the ears of the LORD of _Sabaoth_. Blessed be GOD, that Sir
_Charles_ is so honestly and openly embarked in CHRIST’s cause. My poor
prayers are for him and his, night and day. I hope to see good Lady
_G――――_ in my way to _London_. In the mean while, praying that your
Ladyship may more and more be blessed in the latter stages of your road,
and at last be admitted with triumph into your Master’s joy, is the
earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

                     Your Ladyship’s most dutiful,
                  obliged servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCIV.


                        _To Lady Fanny S――――._

                                            _Bristol, June 16, 1758._

_Honoured Madam_,

I SHALL not for a good while forget my _Twickenham_ journey. It was a
day much to be remembered by unworthy me. LORD, why am I thus highly
favoured? And yet (O unwearied goodness!) he continues to bless me,
vile as I am, more and more. O what delightful field gospel-scenes
have been displayed in _Gloucestershire_, _Bristol_ and _Wales_! There
I have been feebly labouring for above a fortnight.――Thousands and
thousands attended twice every day in various places, and on _Sundays_
the numbers were almost incredible. A blessed influence ran through the
whole circuit, and sundry times, I humbly hoped my longing soul would
have taken its wished-for flight; but I am preserved to return hither,
as last night, and perhaps next week shall see _London_. The LORD
JESUS direct my goings in his ways! Your Ladyship will remember a poor
worthless, but I trust willing pilgrim. You are called to enjoy your
_Bethel_ at home; I meet with them abroad. The same GOD is rich unto
all that call on him faithfully. I hope your Ladyship hath seen dear
Mr. _J――――_ grown in grace. It will be pleasant to see Sir _Charles_
and the Earl striving who shall go fastest to heaven. Your Ladyship
will scorn to be outstript by any. The almighty GOD approves the
ambition, and angels look down with pleasure to see the event. Blessed
be GOD, that is certain. All believers here do run, and all hereafter
shall obtain the prize. That your Ladyship may lay hold of it with
exulting joy, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

              Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and
                   ready servant, for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCV.


                         _To Captain H――――y._

                                            _Bristol, June 16, 1758._

_My very dear Sir_,

THE _Welch_ roads have almost demolished my open one-horse chaise,
as well as me. But it is in JESUS’s cause. Grace! grace! I am almost
ashamed to think of your being put to so much trouble, in procuring a
close chaise for unworthy me. I like the purchase exceeding well, and
send a pepper-corn of acknowledgment for this and all other unmerited
favours. The GOD whom I desire to serve in the gospel of his dear
Son, knows and will reward all. Though I thought I heard the sound
of my blessed Master’s chariot wheels ready to carry me to heaven,
yet it should seem I am once more to see you, and your dear relations,
and my other christian friends on earth. Some time next week I hope
to be there. The legacy is wonderful; much better left for the poor
than me. I can give it away with a good grace: at present I think the
Orphan-house shall have the whole; it is much wanted there. See, my
dear Sir, how the christian’s blessings must be brought out of the
fire. It is inconceivable what I have undergone within these three
weeks. I never was so before. I trust some lasting blessings have
been left behind in _Wales_. Welcome shocks, both of body and mind. In
such a case it is worth dying for. Dear Mr. _D――――_ hath felt them in
_London_, as I have done in _Wales_.――All for the Elect’s sake. Welcome,
thrice welcome the bitter sweets, which the all-wise and compassionate
Physician prescribes; but I am a stubborn patient. O what gripings of
the old man are discovered by such dispensations! I must away to preach.
I thank you heartily, dear Sir, for the continuance of your prayers,
and with most cordial respects to your dear and near relations, I beg
leave to subscribe myself,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCVI.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                            _Bristol, June 17, 1758._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THIS leaves me returned from _Wales_. It proved a most delightful
trying circuit. I suppose your Ladyship hath heard how low I have
been in body, scarce ever lower; not able to sit up in company all the
time, yet strengthened to travel without bodily food, and to preach
to thousands everyday. Never were the fields whiter, and more ready
to harvest. The LORD JESUS seemed to ride in triumph through the great
congregation in _Haverford-west_. Perhaps the auditory consisted of
near fifteen thousand. Tears flowed like water from the stony rock. The
cup of GOD’s people quite runs over. Many were sick of love. Welcome
then bodily pain, and bodily sickness! O for a hearse to carry my weary
carcase to the wished-for grave! “There the wicked cease from troubling,
there the weary are at rest.” But perhaps I must see _London_ first.
With regret I turn my back on this blessed itinerating weather, but
Mr. _Dav――――_ must be released. O for some disinterested soul to help
at the chapel during the summer season! Spiritual, divine ambition,
whither art thou fled! But I see such honours are reserved for few. I
rejoice in the increase of your Ladyship’s spiritual routs. I can guess
at the consolations such uncommon scenes must afford to your Ladyship’s
new-born soul. No wonder you are distressed from other quarters. Indeed,
my most noble and ever-honoured patroness, thus it must be. CHRIST’s
witnesses must be purged at home. Inward domestic trials, fit for
outward public work. Nature recoils, when constrained to take the cup;
and it may be from a near and dear relation’s hand: but infinite Wisdom
knows what is best. O that I could be more passive! O that I could let
the good and all-wise Physician chuse my medicines, and the hands that
shall convey them to me! but I am a stubborn reasoning creature, and
thereby force almighty love frequently to drench me. O, I am sick! I
am sick! sick in body, but infinitely more so in my mind,――to see what
dross yet remains in, and surrounds my soul. Blessed be GOD, there is
one, who will sit as a refiner’s fire, and purify the sons of _Levi_. O
for an heart to bear its scorching, soul purging heat! When I am tried,
I shall come forth as gold. I write this to your Ladyship out of the
burning bush. Blessed place! CHRIST is there! CHRIST is there! To his
never-failing mercy do I most humbly commend your Ladyship, and with
ten thousand thousand thanks for honouring such an unfruitful unworthy
worm with your unmerited patronage, I beg leave to subscribe myself,
ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Newcastle, July 31, 1758._

_My very dear Sir_,

THUS far, a never-failing Redeemer hath brought on the most worthless
and weak pilgrim, that was ever employed in publishing his everlasting
gospel. All the last week was taken up in preaching at _Everton_,
_Saint Neots_, _Kayso_, _Bedford_, _Oulney_, _Weston_, _Underwood_,
_Ravenstone_ and _Northampton_. Four clergymen lent me their churches,
and three read prayers for me in one day. I preached also in Mr.
_Bunyan_’s pulpit, and at _Northampton_ I took the field. Good seasons
at all the places. Mr. _B――――e_, who was lately awakened at _Everton_,
promises to be a burning and shining light. Yesterday we had good times
here, and to-morrow, GOD willing, I shall set off for _Edinburgh_.
My bodily strength increases but very little. Sometimes I am almost
tempted to turn back, but through divine strength I hope to go forward,
and shall strive, as much as in me lies, to die in this glorious work.
GOD will bless you and yours, my very dear Sir, for strengthening my
feeble hands in it, so often as you have done. JESUS knows, and will
reward all labours of love and works of faith. They are more precious
than rubies. GOD willing, you shall hear from me again, when I see how
the LORD deals with me in _Scotland_. In the mean while, be pleased to
add to my obligations by the continuance of your prayers, and accepting
of thanks unfeigned, and cordial love to your whole self, and dear
daughter, from, my very dear friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                        _Edinburgh, August 10, 1758._

_My very dear Friend_,

I THANK you most heartily for your kind letter of invitation to
_G――――_. But alas! what shall I say?――I fear it cannot be complied
with. For above these three months last past, I have been so weak in
my animal frame, that I can scarcely drag the crazy load along. With
great difficulty I came here, and if I should stay to come westward, it
would make my journey to _London_ too far in the year, as I have many
places to call upon in the way. Blessed be GOD, the work prospers in
_London_ more than ever. I am strengthened to preach here twice a day;
but alas, I grow weaker and weaker in preaching, and in all I do for
the ever-loving and altogether lovely JESUS. I suppose you have heard
of the death of Mr. _Jonathan Edwards_.――Happy he!――You will add to
my obligations, by continuing to pray, that the divine strength may be
magnified in my weakness, and that I may speedily (if it be the divine
will) be sent for to my wished-for heaven!――Praying that we may have
a happy meeting there, with ten thousand thanks for all past unmerited
kindnesses, I subscribe myself, very dear friends,

                Yours, &c. in our common glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ My tender love awaits all enquiring friends.

_My very dear Sir_,

NOT till last _Saturday_, did your first long wished-for letter come to
hand. I wonder that _I―――― C――――_ did not dispatch it immediately. As I
knew not what its contents would be, I did not write to _Staffordshire_;
for I was and am determined to fix upon nothing without advising with
you. And indeed, I think the whole must be put off till we can have a
free conference. In the mean while, I shall write to our young friend,
and pray that the friend of all would direct in this important affair.
He will, he will. It is not with Mr. _S――――_ as you imagine. He is
quite free. But more of this when we meet.――_When we meet!_ strange
words for a dying man!――But it seems I am growing better. Within these
four days I have felt a great alteration.――Perhaps it may continue.
GOD’s will be done. Surely, never was there so weak a creature ever
employed in such a work for GOD,――and yet people flock rather more than
ever. Doctor _W――――_ and Mr. _R――――_ often wish you here. We have two
lovely scenes every day. I hope the Redeemer will come with dear Mr.
_D――――_. I bless him for returning you, my dear Sir, in safety. My most
cordial respects attend your dear relations, and beg the continuance of
your prayers, for, my very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCX.

_My very dear Friend_,

IT is a little hard, that we should be so near, and not have a personal
interview. But our LORD orders all things well. Most of my christian
meetings must be adjourned to heaven. Thither I have been in hopes
of going for many weeks last past: but it will not do. This preaching
is a strange restorative. I wish you may take it every day. If things
are not right at home, it is well if we can take or catch fire abroad.
Would strength permit, I could tell you much good news from _London_.
But time is short, and this my body weighs me down. I have thoughts of
leaving _Edinburgh_ on _Tuesday_ next, in order to return to _England_.
Friends object much against it. May the friend of all, guide and
influence. I find no diminution in the auditories, and I trust good is
done. To the giver of every good gift be all the glory! I commend you
and yours to his never-failing mercy, and beg the continuance of your
prayers in behalf of, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

I CAME here a fortnight ago, very low indeed; but by preaching about
thirty times, blessed be GOD, I am a good deal better. Multitudes, of
all ranks, flock twice every day. A divine influence attends the word,
and though sown in so much weakness, I trust it will meet with a divine
increase. On _Tuesday_ next, I thought to have moved; but as it is race
week, and my health is improving, friends advise me to stay, to stir
them up to run with patience the race which is set before us. O that my
sluggish soul may be quickened, and I may begin to press forwards, for
the prize of my high calling! I doubt not but this will find my dear
friend upon the wing for heaven. That you and yours may mount higher
and higher like an eagle, till you fly into the bosom of a waiting GOD,
is the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                        _Edinburgh, August 24, 1758._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

AFTER long meditation and earnest prayer, I cannot come to any
determination about my journey to _Glasgow_. For these four months
last past, I have been brought so exceeding low in my body, that I was
in hopes every sermon I preached would waft me to my wish’d-for home.
_Scotland_, I hoped, would finish my warfare; but it hath rather driven
me back to sea again. By force I have been detained here this race
week; but if I come to _Glasgow_, I shall be detained in _Scotland_ a
fortnight longer, which will greatly hinder me in my _English_ work.
However, I will continue to look up; and by _Saturday_’s post my dear
_Gaius_ may expect a positive answer. LORD JESUS, direct my goings in
thy way! I am much obliged to you and other dear _Glasgow_ friends for
taking notice of such a worthless creature. All I can say is, that I
am less than the least of all, but for CHRIST’s sake, reverend and very
dear Sir,

      Theirs and yours most affectionately in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXIII.

                                      _Edinburgh, September 9, 1758._

_My very dear Friend_,

IT is strange that you and I cannot be more together. I believe Satan
doth not like it: ere long we shall get out of his reach. In heaven we
shall enjoy our GOD and each others company for ever. O that I moved
faster towards it! Complain not. I am the drone, the dwarf, the all
that is worthless and unworthy; but JESUS’ grace is free and infinite.
He owned my feeble labours at _Glasgow_. Indeed we had good seasons:
some quite remarkable. I hear of another clergyman lately awakened in
the north of _England_. Something uncommon is upon the carpet. LORD,
prepare us for whatever thou hast prepared for us. _Wednesday_ next is
_execution-day_; I mean, I am to take my leave. I now bid you and yours
farewel. GOD bless you. Forget not to pray, my very dear friend, for,

                            Ever yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXIV.

                                    _Darlington, September 21, 1758._

_My very dear Friend_,

SURELY it is an age since I had the pleasure of writing to you last.
I was then appointed by Providence to stay at _Edinburgh_ the race
week: since then, I have been at _Glasgow_, and returned to _Edinburgh_
again. At both places my health grew better, and I was enabled to
preach always twice, and sometimes thrice a day, to very large and
affected auditories. The partings from both places were very cutting.
In heaven all this will be over. In my way to _Newcastle_ I preached
twice; and thrice in and about that place. Yesterday I hope some gospel
seed fell on good ground at _Durham_ and _Bishop-Aukland_. I am now in
my way to _Yarm_, and hope to be next Lord’s-day at _Leeds_. GOD only
knows where will be my next remove: I fear not to glory. I am put out
to sea again. If to take some fresh prizes, I shall rejoice. LORD, what
am I! a worthless worm, the chief of sinners, and less than the least
of all saints. And yet what wonders is GOD doing day by day! The fields
are white ready unto harvest: nothing is wanting but labourers. LORD
JESUS, thrust more out for thine infinite mercy’s sake! You have had
victorious scenes at _London_. O that GOD’s goodness may lead us to
a national repentance! Without this, I fear our rejoicing will only
be like the crackling of a few thorns under a pot. However, GOD is
a prayer-hearing GOD. Thousands and tens of thousands, I trust, are
besieging the throne of grace. I am persuaded you are always busy this
way. May you be a prince with GOD, and prevail more and more! I hope
this will find your whole self, and only daughter, enjoying thriving
souls in healthy bodies. That you may increase in every respect with
all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,
under innumerable obligations,

                Yours, &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCXV.

                                           _Leeds, October 11, 1758._

HOW is my very dear friend? I hope, prospering in soul and body. Though
absent from, I am often present with him. Ere long we shall be for
ever with the LORD. But preaching does not kill me, though twice and
sometimes thrice a day, for above this fortnight past. GOD hath been
displaying blessed seasons: thousands and thousands have attended
in various parts. By next Lord’s-day I am to be at _Rotheram_ and
_Sheffield_. Change of weather will alone drive me to Winter quarters.
LORD, prepare me for Winter trials! they are preparatives for an
eternal Summer. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! We have had a most
sorrowful parting this morning. I must away. Love and gratitude would
not suffer me to take horse without dropping another line. I fear I am
troublesome, but you must impute it to the love and regard due to you
from, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

SINCE my leaving _Scotland_, in various parts of the north of
_England_, as at _Alnwick_, _Newcastle_, _Leeds_, &c. the ever-loving,
altogether-lovely JESUS hath manifested forth his glory. Thousands and
thousands have flocked twice, and sometimes thrice a day to hear the
word. Never did I see the fields whiter, or more ripe for a spiritual
harvest. Praise the LORD, O our souls! If the weather continues fair,
I hope to prolong my Summer’s campaign. It shocks me to think of Winter
quarters yet. LORD, help me! How soon does the year roll round! LORD
JESUS, quicken my tardy pace! I suppose by this time Mr. _G――――_ is
got home. Blessed be GOD for owning him. I expect to see him in a few
days. I write this from the house of a once terrible persecutor of her
husband, but now a _Lydia_. What a change doth grace make! As they were
in debt at _Leeds_ for their building, last Lord’s-day I collected for
them near fifty pounds. LORD JESUS, help me to know no party but thine!
This I am persuaded is your catholic spirit. O for an increase of it
among all denominations! I could enlarge, but the people are waiting.
I thank GOD I am not worse in my health. Help me to cry Grace! grace!
I suppose Dr. _W――――_ hath sent you Miss _Prince_’s letter. You will
remember me to dear Mrs. _G――――_ and all friends. I send repeated
thanks for all favours, and earnestly entreat the continuance of their
prayers in behalf of, reverend and very dear Sir,

              Theirs and yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, October 28, 1758._

_My very dear Sir_,

HOW narrowly did I escape seeing you at _Bath!_ I was coming from
_Staffordshire_ to _Bristol_, but the change of weather and shortness
of the days drove me up to my Winter quarters. I took leave of our
young friends, who have been publicly on a scaffold attending a
preached gospel. LORD JESUS, increase such mighty wonders! My health is
somewhat improved, but I find a very little thing soon impairs it. LORD,
help me! How very little can I do for thee! I blush even whilst I am
writing. Quicken, O GOD, my tardy pace! We hope to see you next week.
I wish Mrs. _G――――_ and Mrs. _B――――_ would come up this Winter. We have
had fine gospel seasons. Grace! grace! I could enlarge, but have scarce
got time to write these few ♦lines. I think they are lines of love and
gratitude much owing you by, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

    ♦ “ines” replaced with “lines”




                           LETTER MCCXVIII.


                      _London, November 3, 1758._

_Dear Sir_,

THOUGH I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you next week, yet love
and gratitude constrain me to send you an answer to your kind letter.
Blessed be GOD, that you have some spiritual ministers and people to
converse with! I hope that the waters will be blessed to the recovery
of dear Mr. _H――――_’s health, and that out of his belly will be made
to flow rivers of living waters for the refreshment of many souls.
Dear Mr. _C――――_’s sharp affliction I never heard of till lately: sharp
indeed. GOD make it sweet to his soul! O these _Isaacs_! how hard to
sacrifice! He hath my unfeigned sympathy, and worthless prayers. Dear
Mr. _A――――_’s sister hath met with such another trial: she is left
with five children. As Mr. _A――――_ hath been a steady friend, and his
brother-in-law was a spiritual child, I have proposed putting the two
eldest boys to boarding for one year. Twenty pound will do it. Ten
guineas are already given. Perhaps Mrs. _B――――_ or _G――――_ may speak to
you about it. I write to each by this post. Mr. _A――――_ hath taken the
children with him into _Gloucestershire_. Your kind sisters remembered
them. They and your mother were all here last night. I hope our LORD
was with us too. That is all in all. This must be my Winter _Bethel_.
Without retirement I cannot go on. Comforts come sweetest from
the fountain head. That you may be filled with them, both here and
hereafter, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, November 13, 1758._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I WAS very glad to receive your kind letter dated _August_. Blessed
be GOD that the family is so far reduced, and that I can send you
word a never-failing Providence hath put it into my power to pay off
all _Bethesda_’s arrears. I know this will gladden your heart, and
strengthen your faith in the LORD GOD of _Bethesda_. As yet I hear
nothing of the children. With this you have some bibles and other books.
The LORD JESUS direct me about coming over! I long for an opportunity.
I daily talk of it. But as yet the door seems to be shut. However, the
door for preaching the gospel opens wider and wider. Neither the new
chapel nor the Tabernacle are near big enough. An awakening as well
as comforting influence attends the word, and I trust such are daily
added to the church as shall be saved. I hope if Mr. _Zubly_ settles
in _Georgia_, you will receive frequent benefit from his ministry. You
do not mention how _J―――― P――――_ is disposed of. I am sensible what a
weight must now lie upon you and dear Mrs. _C――――_. But he is faithful
who hath promised, “that as our day is, so shall our strength be.” I
wish you would send me a particular account of the state of my affairs,
and let me know where the children are put out, how they behave, and
whether the colony is in a growing situation. Grace, mercy, and peace
be multiplied upon all! _Amen_, and _Amen_! My wife joins in sending
cordial respects. My blessing to the children. I can but thank you a
thousand and a thousand times for all your labours of love, and praying
that great may be your reward in heaven, I subscribe myself, dear Mr.
_D――――_,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, November 14, 1758._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I HAVE waited with some degree of impatience for the arrival of Mrs.
_B――――_, with whom, I suppose, you sent your letters. The childrens
passage comes hard upon me: but GOD’s will be done! Mr. _J――――n_’s
being at _Georgia_ surprizes me. I told Mrs. _H――――s_ what she must
expect to meet with. But he is faithful who hath promised, “that all
things shall work together for good to those that love Him.” Blessed
be our GOD, whose mercy endureth for ever! I am talking every day of
coming over; but how to do it in war time, or how to get the chapel and
Tabernacle supplied, I cannot as yet be clear in. My eyes are waiting
upon him, who hath promised to direct the paths of those who trust in
him. Surely he will richly reward you, who have left your kindred and
native country, and carefully watched over so many infant lambs in that
new world. I can only send you my most grateful acknowledgments, and
pray continually, “that as your day is, so your strength may be.” Do
send me your thoughts about every thing. It seems by Mr. _D――――_’s
catalogue, that several of the children are almost fit to be put out.
I want your opinion of _A―――― W――――_. LORD, help me to bear every thing
for thy great name’s sake! I must have some thorns; for the word seems
to run and be glorified in town and country more and more. Praise the
LORD, O our souls! I shall here break off, hoping that before the ship
sails, I shall receive the other letters, and then more shall be added
by, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

               Your most obliged friend, and very ready
                      servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

LAST night, after having sent away my packet in the morning, I received
your wish’d-for letter dated in _August_. The others referred to in
that, never came to hand. But I have since sent Mr. ―――― word, that my
affairs should be continued in the present hands. I was never so well
satisfied before; and I have great pleasure in thinking, how you will
be pleased to hear that Providence hath put it into my power to pay
off all arrears. Methinks I hear you say, Blessed be the LORD GOD of
_Bethesda_! Let all my dear family say, _Amen_! I find the little ones
begin to prattle already; but we must learn to do good for CHRIST’s
sake. He will rectify all at the great day. O the happiness of a single
eye! As affairs have so turned out for poor _J――――y_, I am glad you are
abroad; and you see how wonderfully GOD hath provided for your sister.
Be not at all uneasy about your b――――r: he will do better than ever.
Blessed is the man that considers the poor and needy: the LORD shall
deliver him in time of trouble. I am glad the family is lessened.――I
think there are some upon the list, almost ready to be put out. What
think you of _A―――― W――――_ and _G――――_? I wish you would write me your
sentiments of the children. If the girls are not wanted in the house, I
think the sooner they are put out the better. But I leave all to those
in trust. I am more than satisfied, and send you ten thousand thousand
thanks. _Bethesda_’s GOD will thank you before men and angels. My
wife, I believe, hath written to you. I write this from my _Bethel_ at
_Tottenham-Court_, where I come for a little retreat. Twelve _widows
indeed_ are in their houses near me, and GOD is doing wonders at this
end of the town. Help me to praise this wonder-working GOD, and doubt
not of being always remembered by, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
                    ready servant in CHRIST JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, December 5, 1758._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

NOTWITHSTANDING I wrote to you lately, another opportunity offers to
send you a line. I send you repeated thanks for your steadiness and
care in that house of mercy. With this also come the things you sent
for, except Bishop _Hall_’s select works, which cannot be immediately
procured. I should be glad if a little rice, indigo, &c. could be sent,
that friends might see some of the Orphan house produce. Pray be as
particular as you can in your account of every thing. To whom is _T――――
P――――_ bound out? I have sent to _B―――― W――――_’s father, about sending
for him home. If some are not worthy, others will be. Blessed be
GOD that the arrears will be paid off. You will see my letter to
Mr. _P――――_. The LORD direct me and all how to act! I hope my old
assistants will continue in their places; and I pray earnestly, that
_Bethesda_ may yet take deeper root downwards, and bear yet abundantly
more fruit upwards. Surely the GOD of the sea and the GOD of the dry
land will open a door for my embarkation by and by. Hasten, O LORD,
that wish’d-for time! The child lately sent over, is recommended by Mr.
_J―――― C――――_. That we all may continually be recommended to the Father
of Mercies, by his dear and all-prevailing Son JESUS CHRIST, is the
earnest prayer of, dear Mr. _D――――_,

                          Yours, &c. in Him,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

IT is now a long time since I heard from _Bethesda_. The draughts,
GOD willing, shall be answered. We live in a changing world, and
_Bethesda_’s GOD liveth for ever and ever. His word runs and is
glorified daily, especially at _Tottenham-Court_. Strange! that nobody
will relieve me, that I may once more flee to _America_. But, heavenly
Father, our times are in thy hands: do with us as seemeth good in thy
sight! O that _Bethesda_’s little flock may take deep root downward,
and bear fruit upwards! O that you may be helped to lean on your
Beloved! Surely GOD will bless you for taking care of the fatherless
children. A pepper-corn of acknowledgment, and my poor prayers, are the
only return that I can make you. I am in expectation of hearing from
you every day. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon you
all, is the earnest prayer of, my dear Mrs. _C――――_,

               Your most affectionate friend and willing
                      servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

THIS day se’nnight, through divine goodness, I came hither. The next
day the Spring campaign was opened: on the Lord’s-day we took the field.
Thousands and thousands attended: full as many as in _London_. The
power of the LORD was present at the three meetings, as well as at
the holy communion. Some cups were made to run over. Ever since I have
been enabled to preach twice, and sometimes thrice a day. Never did
I see the _Bristol_ people more attentive or impressed. My body feels
the heat: but no matter. If souls are benefited, all is well. Would
to GOD I could begin to do something for JESUS! You are employed one
way, I another. Ere long we shall sit down together in the kingdom of
our Father. Next _Monday_ perhaps I may move towards _Gloucester_. I
know you will follow me with your prayers. Mine always attend you and
yours. It is the only return that can be made for all your kindnesses
conferred on, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

THERE hath been a long interval between my last and this. My quick
motions, and frequent preaching, have been the causes. O what am I that
I should be employed for JESUS! In _Gloucestershire_ the cup of many
of his people ran over. In _Yorkshire_ I preached for a week twice a
day. Great congregations! great power! Blessed be the name of the great
GOD for ever and ever! Here also people, high and low, rich and poor,
flock as usual, morning and evening. I am growing fat: but, as I take
it to be a disease, I hope I shall go home the sooner. Happy they who
are safe in harbour. A storm I fear ♦is at hand. JESUS will be our
hiding-place. He shall preserve us in trouble: he shall compass us
about with songs of deliverance. That this may be the peculiar lot of
you and yours, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

                Yours, &c. under manifold obligations,

                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

GOD willing, I purpose to see _G――――_; but cannot as yet fix the day.
I preach, and people flock as usual; but _Scotland_ is not _London_.
The Redeemer is doing wonders there. Every post brings forth good news.
GOD’s Spirit blows when and where it listeth. O for a gale before the
storm! I expect one is at hand. The refuge is as near. JESUS is our
hiding-place. O for a hiding-place in heaven! When will my turn come?
Some say, not yet; for (would you think it?) I am growing fat: so did
Mr. _Darracot_ a little before he died. O that my latter end may be
like his! You will not forget a worthless but willing pilgrim. Hearty
love to all.

                   Yours, &c. &c. in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I DO now begin to despair of seeing you, till we meet in that world,
where spiritual children and spiritual fathers shall join in praising
Him who sitteth upon the throne for ever. _O proclaram diem!_ Welcome
storms which drive us nearer that blessed port. Some here, I trust, are
steering their course that way. Impressions seem to be lasting on many.
In the West, I think, I was rather more attended, and a greater power
accompanied the word. LORD, what am I? On _Monday_, or _Tuesday_ at the
farthest, GOD willing, I move. _Scotch_ importunities have prevailed on
me to stay till then. O for some parting blessings! An ascended Saviour
can impart them. I have good news from the Orphan-house. All is well
there. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon you and
yours, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Edinburgh, July 12, 1759._

_My very dear Friend_,

IT is well there is a heaven to make amends for all our disappointments
here on earth. I long for a future state, where we shall all sit down
together, and converse for ever without the least interruption. I know
this will find you looking towards, and waiting for the coming of that
day of GOD. It is a blessed thing to be kept alive in a dead time.
It is a dead time in _Scotland_ indeed. Little or no stirring among
the dry bones. It is not so in _London_, and several other parts of
_England_. LORD JESUS, revive thy work in the midst of the years!
You will pray that the fatal languor may not take hold of my already
too languid heart. I would fain be found of my LORD with my loins
girded, and my lamp burning. A storm seems to be at hand. JESUS is our
hiding-place.

              Blest is faith that trusts his power,
              Blest are saints that wait his hour:
              Haste, great Conqueror, bring it near;
              Let the glorious close appear.

O that some may be awakened to prepare for that awful hour! On _Monday_,
GOD willing, I go to blow the gospel trumpet at _Glasgow_. LORD, what
am I, that I should be one of thy run-abouts! If this be to be vile,
LORD, make me more vile! Adieu. Hearty love and most cordial respects
await your whole self. Follow me with your prayers, and as the LORD
JESUS enables, they shall be returned by, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mrs. W――――_,

MAKE no apology for writing your mind. I see the disease, but know
not how to come at a cure. Labourers are wanting of the _old stamp_:
but vines are very apt to degenerate. If I am not mistaken, we shall
be purged with a witness. GOD grant it may be that we may bring forth
more fruit. I want the purgation most of all. I dread a corpulent
body. But it breaks in upon me like an armed man. O that my heart
may not wax gross at the same time! I would fain not flag, but rather
begin at least to begin in the latter stages of my road. Congregations
in _Scotland_ are very large. I am glad to hear that the shout of a
king is among you. Pray remember me in the kindest manner to all in
conference, and to all that are so kind as to enquire after, dear Mrs.
_W――――_,

          Your sincere friend and servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Newcastle, August 16, 1759._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

LONG before now I hope you have had the pleasure of seeing _Bethesda_’s
debts all paid. _Bethesda_ (now outward burdens are off) I trust
will be more agreeable every day. I do not want to change its present
Governess. This, I fear, would be the case, was Mr. _P――――_ and his
family to come. I fear you would then think yourself discharged.
Besides, he seems to want me to resign my trust entirely. This all
here dissuade me from, upon any terms, or to any person whatsoever. As
you and Mr. _D――――_ are so faithful, if Mr. _P――――_ will continue to
superintend till I come, matters may continue as they are. O when shall
I receive my commission to go abroad. GOD only knows what awaits us at
home. JESUS is our hiding-place. I am now in my return from _Scotland_.
For these six weeks last past, the word hath run and been glorified
there. O, who is a God like unto our GOD, glorious in holiness, fearful
in praises, continually doing wonders! he will be our GOD and guide
unto death. That he may continually fill you with his grace here, and
grant you an exalted place, near his throne, in his kingdom hereafter,
is the earnest prayer of, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and
               ready servant in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I HOPE that soon after your writing in _February_ last, my _November_
letters came to hand, and that Mr. _P――――l_ hath been over with you,
to discharge all _Bethesda_ debts. Blessed be GOD for causing his work
to prosper in your hands. Pray be always as particular as you can about
the children, and set them upon writing often. Mr. _Zubly_’s coming
to _Georgia_ pleases me much. Pray let me have the whole account from
last audit. I am glad you have taken in three more orphans; they will
turn out great prizes in the last day. Poor Mr. _I――――s_!――Let him
that standeth take heed lest he fall. LORD JESUS, give us a right
understanding in all things! He is an ever-loving and ever-lovely
JESUS. His power hath been made known in _Scotland_ for these six
weeks last past. Some books will be sent from thence to the care of Mr.
_Hodsden_. The box which I sent in _Burkitt_ some months ago, I hear
was taken;――it had a gown in it, and several other things. “The LORD
hath given, and the LORD hath taken away: blessed be the name of the
LORD!” We have a GOD that will supply all our wants, according to the
riches of his mercy in CHRIST JESUS. O to be faithful unto the death!
we shall then receive a crown of life. That this may be your happy
portion, is the earnest prayer of, my dear Mr. _D――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _London, August 30, 1759._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

THE bearers of this are well known to Mr. _D――――n_. I trust, I can
recommend them as the followers of JESUS CHRIST. I wish _Bethesda_ may
be a comfortable asylum for them. I think that Mr. _S――――k_, for the
present, might be employed about the lands round the orphan-house,
and so gradually learn to be overseer at _Ephrata_. _John H――――y_, I
suppose, will be for moving in a year or two. I wish he may be capable
to do for himself. I am told that he drinks; but I do not love to catch
at ill reports against those that are employed in my house. Pray let
me hear particularly concerning him. Mrs. _S――――k_ is a quiet teachable
woman. I think she might be of service to you immediately, and with
her husband do quite well, in a short time, at the plantation. You will
soon be able to judge. If ―――― doth not turn out as you desire, and is
not of use in the house, let her be put out to some good service: she
is capable now of doing for herself. Mr. _D――――n_ will be so kind as to
take care of the little boy. He is quite an orphan, and I am told very
quiet, and willing to learn. Would to GOD I was coming with them. But
the way at present is quite blocked up. LORD JESUS, open it in thy due
time! I hope you do not so much as think of seeing _England_ till I
come over. Mrs. _S――――k_ hath directions to leave _Bethesda_, if you
think her coming any reason for your remove; that would grieve me to
the heart. I think myself quite happy in such an assistant, and hope,
now all debts are paid, you will be free from many burdens. O what hath
GOD wrought? wonders, wonders! Praise the LORD, O our souls! I should
be glad of Mr. _P――――l_ at _Bethesda_; but I can give him no more
power than he hath. All are against my giving up my trust to any person
whatsoever. LORD JESUS, continue to be _Bethesda_’s GOD! Should not
_H――――y_’s daughter be put out to service. Orphan-house plants ought to
be transplanted, to make room for others, and then the family will not
be too large. I commit you, and all, to his never failing mercy, and am,
dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most obliged, affectionate friend, and
                   ready servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I CAN but send you my poor pepper-corn of thanks unfeigned, for your
continued care of dear _Bethesda_. Now all is paid, I hope your best
days are to come. Do not entertain a thought of leaving a place, in
which you have your health, and are so useful. If Mr. _S――――k_ can
supply _Ephrata_, then all that family will be gone soon. Blessed be
GOD that some of the girls turn out so well! The worsted and stays
will be sent with this. I hope to write again soon. I am not sorry
that _Lory_ is like to be disposed of, but I would have another negroe
bought in her room. O that JESUS would wash them in his blood. Little
_Reader_’s letter pleased us much. I would have all the boys to write.
O that JESUS may convert them! Amen and Amen! Some of the books coming
over, may be dispersed among the people at _Oqueehec_, and elsewhere,
if not wanted at _Bethesda_. I want a master sadly for _G――――_, &c. I
trust the LORD will provide.

              Blest is faith that trusts His power,
              Blest are the saints that wait his hour.

Your sister I hear turns out very well. Would to GOD I could say so of
all my relations!

                But surely GOD’s rich grace is free;
                For, O my GOD! it found out me.

Hoping to have another speedy opportunity of writing again, with ten
thousand thanks for all your care, and most earnest prayers for your
increasing with all the increase of GOD, I must hasten to subscribe
myself, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

            Your most affectionate obliged friend, and very
                 ready servant in our glorious JESUS,

_My very dear Mr. D――――_,

YOUR letter dated _May 25_, which I received yesterday by the hands of
Mr. _Vincent_, gave me unspeakable satisfaction. I can but thank you,
as I do ten thousand times over, for all your care and faithfulness.
He that seeth in secret will ere long reward openly. As I hear both
_Dickenson_ and _Ball_ are arrived, you will have received more
letters from me. GOD be praised for your success in the silk-worms!
GOD be praised that _Bethesda_ is out of debt! GOD be praised for all
his tender mercies to me and mine! Praise the LORD, O our souls! I
wish some of the children could be bred up for the ministry. _G――――_
seems to me to have some grace. What a pity that I cannot have a
grammar-school! I shall think and pray, and then write to you and Mr.
_P――――l_ on this head. You all seem to dislike the temper of those at
_Ephrata_. If Mr. _S――――k_ could supply the place, perhaps it would be
more pleasant. May the LORD JESUS direct, for his name’s sake! He will,
he will! It is a most discouraging thing, that good places cannot be
found for the boys when fit to go out. By this means, they are kept in
the house beyond their time, both to their own hurt, and to the further
expence of the institution. I expect _R―――― W――――_ home with Captain
_Ball_. I am glad _B――――_ is at a trade. Somebody told his mother, that
he was gone to his master’s plantation. I wish he had written a line.
Could you let me know what stock of cattle you have, and what hogs you
kill. The more particular you are about every thing, the better. I long
for the account. I am glad you received the books! more are to be sent
from _Scotland_. I do not much care for _R――――_’s being at _Bethesda_,
unless he is a true penitent. How doth my nephew go on? That you may
go on and prosper both in body and soul, till you are safe landed in an
endless eternity, is the earnest prayer of, very dear Mr. _D――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, February 5, 1760._

_My very dear Mr. D――――_,

I AM waiting every moment for a line from you. I hope it will bring
me the agreeable news of your being at peace with the _Indians_. Above
all, I trust it will inform me, of your being filled with the peace of
GOD, which passeth all understanding. As I wrote my whole mind by dear
Mr. _S――――k_, and who, I find by the papers, is safely arrived, I have
nothing to add, till I hear what Mr. _P――――l_ hath determined on, and
what situation Mr. _S――――_ thinks himself called to. My heart’s desire
and prayer to GOD is, that all may be directed for the Redeemer’s glory,
and the lasting welfare of _Bethesda_. I cannot help thinking, but
something great is to come out of it yet. The thoughts of a College are
revived; but he that believeth doth not make haste. I am growing very
corpulent, but, I trust, not too corpulent for another voyage, when
called to it. Every day the work increases. On _Sunday_ last, a new
enlargement of the chapel was opened, and a great concourse of people
assembled on that occasion. I am told that GOD was there. With this, I
hope you will receive a box of books. My nephew hath some more for you,
in a box sent to him. I have had a sweet letter from _I―――― P――――m_.
O this changing world! LORD, sanctify all for the better preparing us
for our great change! Adieu, my dear friend. I hope you will keep close
to _Bethesda_. GOD will bless you for it. Hoping to hear from you very
shortly, I hasten to subscribe myself,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

_My dear Mrs. C――――_,

I SEND this to _Portsmouth_ after Mr. _R――――n_, to inform you, that
last night we received your agreeable letters, dated in _August_ and
_September_. Blessed be GOD that you are all so well. The bills shall
be honoured. I have thoughts, that you and Mr. _D――――_ will come
together. For CHRIST’s sake, do not think of moving from _Bethesda_. I
am more than pleased: I am delighted with your being there. The family
will soon be small indeed. It is easily increased at any time. I hope
that _G――――_ and _A―――― W――――_ will be put out. I am glad _S――――f_
behaved so well. GOD’s judgments are like the great deep. Father, thy
will be done! Mr. _S――――f_ bears the news quite well. I expect to hear
again from you every day. GOD bless you all! Cease not to pray for,
dear Mrs. _C――――_,

               Your most obliged affectionate friend and
                      servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCXXXVII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                             _Bristol, July 5, 1760._

_My very dear Sir_,

WITH this, I have sent an order to Mr. _C――――_, to receive of you
three hundred pounds sterling, to purchase bills of exchange from Mr.
_S――――r_. One hundred Mr. _S――――r_ is to remit to Mr. _F――――y_. The
other two hundred Mr. _C――――_ is to pay to Mr. _Z――――n_, in order to
be remitted to Professor _F――――k_. The remainder, I think best to keep
till I hear from the Professor himself. The LORD pity and comfort the
poor sufferers! What reason have we to be thankful, who abound in peace
and plenty! What is still more, the fields are white, ready unto a
spiritual harvest. When in the fields, ten thousand, perhaps more, do
assemble here. When under cover, there are more than the tabernacle
will well hold; at least in the evening. Every time the house is a
_Bethel_, a house of GOD, a gate of heaven. Grace! grace! I thought
that my wife’s illness would have hastened me to _London_; but as she
is now recovering, I would fain proceed in my summer’s campaign. I
am persuaded I am the better for your prayers. Never were they more
charitably bestowed. I am a worm, and no man. O blessed JESUS, how good
thou art! With all thy other mercies, give, O give me an humble and a
thankful heart! I could enlarge, but have more letters to write. I hope
my most cordial respects and thanks will find acceptance with dear Mrs.
_S――――_ and Miss, and I am sure you will accept the same yourself, from,
my very dear Sir,

                 Yours &c. under manifold obligations,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCXXXVIII.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                             _Bristol, July 8, 1760._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I HOPE this will find you restored to more than former health and
usefulness, and quite determined to continue at _Bethesda_. It makes
me uneasy, to think you have the least inclination of returning, till
you see me on your side the water. JESUS hath called and blessed you
at _Bethesda_. I would fain have you stay and see the fruits of your
labour. You will see what I wrote about _I―――― H――――_. I must leave
all to you who are upon the spot, not doubting but the LORD JESUS
will guide you by his allwise counsel; none teacheth like him. I have
sympathized with you, in respect to your fears about the _Indian_ war.
LORD JESUS grant they may not be permitted to come near your peaceful
dwelling! In heaven, all these alarms will be over. I long for those
blessed mansions. But nothing kills me. My wife was lately just got
into harbour, but is driven back again. Blessed be GOD, we are sure
of getting in safe at last. JESUS is our pilot. To his almighty and
never-failing protection do I most humbly and heartily commit you, as
being, for his great name’s sake, with ten thousand thanks for all your
labours of love, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your sincere affectionate friend, and ready
                      servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                             _Bristol, July 8, 1760._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I OWE you much love for your letter and accompts. May _Bethesda_’s GOD
bless and reward you! He doth, he will. I suppose you will see what I
have written to Mr. _P――――l_ and Mr. _S――――k_. How doth the Redeemer
bring his elect together, even in this world! What a glorious meeting
will there be in the world to come! Methinks I hear you say, “Come,
LORD JESUS, come quickly.” I add, Amen and amen! even so come LORD
JESUS! The prospect is promising. I am going in my old way, saving that
I grow fatter and fatter every day. LORD, help me to work it down! but
it seems working will not do. I spent all the last winter in _London_,
and began my campaign in _May_, in _Gloucestershire_. Last month I was
in _Wales_, inviting souls to come to CHRIST. Here I am labouring also.
You will not fail to pray for me. I long to hear about the _Indian_
war. They are safe who are garrisoned in GOD, even a GOD in CHRIST.
Assure yourself, that neither you nor your dear orphan-charge are ever
forgotten by, my dear Mr. _D――――_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCXL.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                           _London, August 15, 1760._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

HOW do I long to hear of GOD’s appearing for _Georgia_ and _Bethesda_?
I trust, the _Indians_ have not, and will not be permitted to disturb
a family planted by his own right hand, and for his own glory. But
the divine judgments are a great deep. LORD, help us to adore, and
cheerfully to submit to thy holy will! Some _Bethesda_ letters, I
trust, will soon put me out of suspense. I wrote to you by the convoy
that took your new Governor. I hope he will behave friendly to the
orphan-house. If we make the LORD JESUS our friend, all will be well.
Many here are seeking his friendship. Satan is angry. I am now mimicked
and burlesqued upon the public stage. All hail such contempt! GOD
forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of JESUS CHRIST. It is
sweet! it is sweet. What a mercy is it, that we have got an abiding
inheritance in the kingdom of heaven! Of this we can never be robbed.
_Hallelujah!_――Adieu. Hearty love to all. Cease not to pray for, and
write to, dear Mr. _D――――_,

                Yours, &c. in our glorious High Priest,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, November 14, 1760._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I CANNOT find any of your relations, but what are willing you should
remain in _Georgia_, and settle there. What condition can be so useful
for you? I have never varied in my opinion. The LORD JESUS direct,
bless, and reward you! He will. The orphan sent by Captain _Ball_, I am
persuaded will be taken care of. He is sent by good Lady _H――――n_, and
is to be treated as a common orphan. May the Father of the fatherless
bless him and all! I was much pleased with the letters I received
from the lambs of the flock. If possible, I shall answer them. But
at present am so indisposed with a cold, after my _Yorkshire_ ramble
of two months, that I can scarce write this. Blessed be GOD, for the
prospect of a state, wherein the inhabitants shall no more say, I am
sick. I can now add no more, but that I am, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

              Your most obliged friend, and ready servant
                          in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXLII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                         _London, February 21, 1761._

_My dear Timothy_,

THE distance that _Plymouth_ lies from _London_, is one great cause of
my coming there so seldom. What can I do, who have so many calls, and
so few assistants? _London_ must be minded. For surely, there the word
runs and is glorified more and more. I returned in post-haste, last
month, from _Bristol_. Both in going and coming, dear Mr. _H――――y_ and
I were in great jeopardy. Once the machine fell over, and at another
time we were obliged to leap out of the post-chaise, though going very
fast. Blessed be GOD, we received little hurt. Good was to be done. On
the fast-day, near six hundred pounds were collected for the _German_
and _Boston_ sufferers. Grace! grace! I wish you had collected at
_Bristol_. When can you move? pray let me know directly. I want my wife
to ride as far as _Plymouth_. Nothing but exercise will do with her.
Remember us to your whole self, and to all. This is the very first
moment that I could catch, to let you hear from, my dear man,

                Yours, &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_.

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCXLIII.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                         _London, February 23, 1761._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

IT is almost an age now, since I heard from my dear family in the
wilderness. How came I not to have one line by Mr. _Young_? Ere now
I hope you have received my last by Captain _Ball_. When shall I get
leave to come over? Perhaps my heart is too much set upon it. Father,
thy will be done! This is my comfort; the Redeemer’s work is upon the
advance. All opposition is over-ruled for the furtherance of the gospel.
A new instrument is raised up out of _Cambridge_ university. He has
been here preaching like an angel of the churches indeed. My wife is
poorly, but joins in sending hearty love. All your relations are well.
Pray give my blessing to the children, and thank them all for their
letters. I would have all the boys put out as soon as of age. The work
prospers here much. Hoping every day to receive a line, and sending you
my most hearty blessing, thanks and love, I subscribe myself, dear Mrs.
_C――――_,

              Your most affectionate obliged friend, and
               ready servant in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXLIV.


                           _To Mr. A――――s._

                                             _London, March 3, 1761._

_My very dear Mr. A――――s_,

MY last showed you that we are both of a mind. Let us have a little
patience, and all will be well. As Mr. _B――――e_ cannot come up directly,
I must defer my _Bristol_ journey till after _Easter_. The cold I
catched there, I shall not easily get rid off. But what is, is best.
Your letter to Mrs. _J――――s_ was delivered safe. By _Wiltshire_’s
waggon, I have sent a set of _Henry’s Exposition_, and _Clark’s Bible_.
Be pleased to take them. You will send the enclosed. The Redeemer
continues to own and bless us here. That he may bless and own you and
yours evermore, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear _Timothy_,

                  Yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                            _London, March 14, 1761_.

_My dear Sir_,

I HEAR that your little daughter is gone to heaven: a fine flower soon
cropped. I thought she was too fine to continue long in this bad soil.
She is now transplanted to an infinitely better. O that I may have
patience to wait till my wish’d-for change do come! Every day almost we
hear of persons dying in triumph. The awakening is rather greater than
ever. Satan’s artillery hath done but little execution.

                Thoughts are vain against the LORD,
                All subserves his standing word;
                Wheels encircling wheels must run,
                Each in course to bring it on.
                                        Hallelujah!

I hope you prosper at _G――――_. My kindest respects await all your dear
reverend brethren that honour me with their countenance, your whole
self, and all who are so kind as to enquire after, my dear Sir,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ One Mr. _Berridge_, lately Moderator of _Cambridge_, hath been
preaching here with great flame.

_Dear Sir_,

BE pleased to pay to Mr. _Thomas Cox_ the sum of two hundred and fifty
pounds, which, with one hundred and fifty paid to him before, and given
(as this is to be) into the hands of the Reverend Mr. _Zingenhagen_,
makes up the sum of four hundred pounds; the whole of what is assigned
out of the late collection for the distressed _German_ protestants, by,
dear Sir,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

ACCEPT a few lines of love unfeigned from a worthless worm, just
returning from the borders of an eternal world. O into what a world was
I launching! But the prayers of GOD’s people have brought me back. LORD
JESUS, let it be for thy glory and the welfare of precious and immortal
souls! Thou hast been digging and dunging round me. O that the barren
fig-tree may at length begin to bring forth some fruit! O, my dear
man, how ought ministers to work before the night of sickness and
death comes, when no man can work! LORD JESUS, quicken my tardy pace,
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies! You will not cease to
pray for me, who am indeed less than the least of all. Weakness forbids
my enlarging. Hearty love to all who are so kind as to enquire after an
ill and hell-deserving, but redeemed creature. Not only pray, but also
give thanks to a never-failing _Emmanuel_, who hath been ease in pain,
health in sickness, life in death, to, my very dear friend,

               Yours, &c. &c. for his great name’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCXLVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                     _Cannonbury-House, May 2, 1761._

SURPRIZING, that any friends of _Zion_ should be solicitous for the
welfare of such a worthless worm! Indeed, my dear friend, the news you
have heard was true. I have been at the very gates of what is commonly
called death. They seemed opening to admit me, through the alone
righteousness of the blessed JESUS, into everlasting life. But at
present they are closed again: for what end, an all-wise Redeemer can
only tell. I have, since my illness, once assisted a little at the
Lord’s-supper, and once spoke a little in publick. But, my locks are
cut; natural strength fails: JESUS can renew: JESUS can cause to grow
again. By his divine permission, I have thoughts of seeing _Scotland_.
If I relapse, that will be a desirable place to go to heaven from.
I love, I love that dear people. Ten thousand thanks to you, and
all my dear _G――――_ friends. Be pleased to add to my obligations, by
continuing to pray for one, who, though less than the least of all, is
indeed, my very dear Sir,

            Theirs and yours, &c. in a never-failing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXLIX.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                            _Plymouth, June 5, 1761._

WILL not my very dear and valuable friend be glad to hear, that through
divine mercy I am somewhat improved in my health since my leaving
_London_. At _Bristol_ I grew sensibly better, but hurt myself by too
long journies to _Exeter_ and hither. However, blessed be GOD, I am
now recovered from my fatigue, and hope bathing will brace me up for
my glorious Master’s use again.

              Strange, that a harp of thousand strings,
              Should keep in tune so long!

The few times I have been enabled to preach, an infinitely
condescending Redeemer hath vouchsafed to breathe upon the word
preached. Who knows but I may get my wings again? Abba Father, all
things are possible with thee! I know who doth, and will pray for
me, even my very dear Mr. _S――――_, who hath already laid such great
obligations on

              His most affectionate friend and very ready
                  servant in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear steady Friend_,

ACCEPT a few lines of love unfeigned, from one who loves both you
and yours in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. They leave me rather hurt by
my late western journey. I strive to put out to sea as usual, but my
shattered bark will not bear it. LORD JESUS, let thy will be done in me,
by me, and upon me, for time and eternity! If this air doth not agree
with me, in a few days I think of returning to my old nurses and old
physicians again. Blessed be GOD for an interest in an infinitely great,
infinitely gracious, and sympathizing unchangeable physician! I hope
you and yours enjoy much of his heart-chearing consolations. These have
been my support in my younger days; these will be my cordials in the
latter stages of the road. I hope Mr. and Mrs. _J――――_ are quite well.
Pray tell him not to be so touchy to his old friends, especially when
they are sick and just returning from the grave: perhaps he may not be
troubled with them long. GOD grant he may never feel the want of them!
JESUS lives when ministers die. My hearty love awaits you all. Cease
not to pray for, my dear Mr. _K――――n_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCLI.


                                   _Cannonbury-House, July 11, 1761._

_My dear Timothy_,

JUST as I was going to write you a few lines to come hither, Mr.
_Rowand_’s letter informed me that you was very ill. But I hope this
will find you better. LORD JESUS, prepare us for whatever thou hast
prepared for us! Commending you to his never-failing mercy, I subscribe
myself,

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                                           _July 16._

Blessed be GOD I am better! Blessed be GOD that you are so likewise!
Who knows what rest and time may produce? O to be blanks in the hands
of JESUS! When shall this once be! What good news by sea and land!
Grace! grace! Let me have another line, and cease not to pray for, my
dear _Timothy_,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                          _London, October 13, 1761._

_My dear Fellow-prisoner_,

I HOPE an all-wise Redeemer is teaching us to be content to be buried
ourselves, and to bury our friends alive. This is a hard but important
lesson. LORD JESUS, make us great proficients in the school of thy
cross! I have not preached a single sermon for some weeks. Last
_Sunday_ I spoke a little; but I feel its effects ever since. Father,
thy will be done! Blessed be his name for giving you a little reviving
in your bondage. Perhaps that is all we are to expect on this side
eternity. But there is nothing too hard for the LORD. LORD, we believe,
help our unbelief! Glory be to his great name, that some good was
done at _Plymouth_. The news drove me to my knees, and stirred up an
ambition to be employed again. I know you and _Sarah_ will say, _Amen_,
and _Amen_! I hope your _Isaac_ will be spared; if not, _Aaron_-like,
may you hold your peace! I have met with changes. My two old servants
are married and gone. Mr. _E――――_ hath preached for me some time. As
yet the congregations are kept up. Mr. _A――――_ and _M――――_ are very
poorly. All are hastening home apace. Accept hearty love to your whole
self, and all dear friends who are so kind as to enquire after, my very
dear _Timothy_,

                       Yours, &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLIII.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                           _Leeds, October 24, 1761._

_My very dear Mr. D――――_,

WHAT sudden changes here! O that my great change was come! Happy
_Polhill_: _Bethesda_’s loss is thy gain. “Be ye also ready,” is the
call of this awful providence. The LORD furnish survivors with double
strength! I thank you for the accounts. I see you are running in
arrears. Some way or other I trust they will be discharged. But I would
have the family reduced as low as can be. I think that the keeping of
those who are grown up, hurts them and increases my expence. I have
little comfort in many that I have assisted. But our reward of grace
is with the LORD. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! As you are most
conversant in figures, you will be pleased to continue in your usual
way; and as you go on in harmony, I trust you will do quite well. A
sea voyage seems more necessary to me now than ever. I know now what
nervous disorders are. Blessed be GOD that they were contracted in his
service. I do not repent my embarking in CHRIST’s cause. He seeth all
your disinterested toil in that new world. “Well done, ye good and
faithful servants,” shall be the salutation given to you all. My hearty
blessing and love to all. That great may be your happiness on earth,
and infinitely great your reward in heaven, is the earnest prayer of,
my very dear Mr. _D――――_,

              Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLIV.

                                           _Leeds, October 24, 1761._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I AM still in this dying world, but frequently tempted to wish the
report of my death had been true, since my disorder keeps me from my
old delightful work of preaching. But JESUS can teach us to exercise
our passive as well as active graces. Fain would I say, “Thy will be
done!” I am now riding for my health; but I think a voyage would brace
me up. I impute my present disorder, in a great measure, to the want of
my usual sea voyages. Blessed be GOD, for supporting me so well under
the news of dear Mr. _Polhill_’s sudden translation. In that respect, I
rather envy than pity him; to be carried to heaven in an instant; from
a ship’s cabin into _Abraham_’s bosom; O what a blessing! GOD sanctify
and make up the loss! But we shall find few _Polhills_. Blessed be
GOD, that I have faithful ones left behind. I repose in you the utmost
confidence, and hope the LORD will give you double strength, and
vouchsafe us all a speedy and happy meeting. I know who adds a hearty
_Amen_. I wish _G――――r_ and _A―――― W――――_ were put out. Keeping such
great boys is expensive, and there is nothing to be expected by my
coming over. I hope my nephew will take the boy that comes over; if not,
he must be received at _Bethesda_. Surely GOD will yet provide for that
house of mercy. But I can at present bear very little of outward cares.
Writing these few letters, I fear, will hurt me: but I could not help
venturing. The LORD bless and reward you, my dear Mrs. _C――――_, for
all your labours of love! I commend you and your dear charge to his
never-failing mercy, and am, with ten thousand thanks for all favours,

             Yours most affectionately for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                       _Newcastle, October 29, 1761._

_My dear steady Friend_,

HITHERTO the LORD hath helped me. Surely his mercy endureth for ever.
I bear riding sixty miles a day in a post-chaise quite well. Blessed
be his name, friends both here and at _Leeds_ are prudent, and do not
press me to preach much. But I hope I am travelling in order to preach.
If not, LORD JESUS, help me to drink the bitter cup of a continued
silence, with a holy resignation, believing that what is, is best!
LORD, I believe, help thou my unbelief! Every where as I came along,
my spiritual children gladly received me. Almighty GOD, do thou provide
for all! I hope you go on well at _London_. It is the _Jerusalem_,
the _Goshen_. May ministers and people see their privileges, and work
whilst it is day! The night of sickness and death is coming, when no
man can work. Be pleased to remember me to dear Mr. and Mrs. _J――――_,
and all dear friends as they come in your way. To-morrow I may set
forwards towards _Edinburgh_. You and yours will follow me with your
prayers, and be assured of not being forgotten by, my very dear Mr.
_K――――n_,

                  Yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLVI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                       _Newcastle, October 29, 1761._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

THOUGH at a very unexpected, and seemingly unseasonable time, I am thus
far travelled northwards. Hitherto the LORD hath helped me to hold out.
Fain would I reach _Scotland_, to see some of my dear friends before
I die. My spirits, though in some degree recruited, are yet low, and
I am kept from my old delightful work. But all things are possible
with JESUS CHRIST. He can either restore, or enable me to drink the
bitter cup of continued silence. LORD JESUS, do thou help me to say
from my inmost soul, “Father, not my will, but thine be done!” I desire
to be more than remembered to my dear _G――――_ friends, and beg the
continuance of their prayers in behalf of, my very dear Sir,

             Theirs and yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLVII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                       _Edinburgh, November 9, 1761._

THOUGH I have been very ill since my coming to _Edinburgh_, yet I must
come just to see my dear friends at _G――――_. I cannot be there till
_Thursday_ noon. Little, very little can be expected from a dying man.
But I can now hear a little for myself. I write this in the midst of
company. All my dear friends will not fail to pray for, very dear Sir,

                    Yours and theirs, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLVIII.

                                           _Leeds, December 1, 1761._

_My dear old Friend_,

IT is near ten at night, and I am to set off to-morrow in the _Leeds_
stage for _London_. Your letter I received this evening, and thank
you for it most heartily. Silence is enjoined me for a while by the
_Edinburgh_ physicians. They say my case is then recoverable. The great
physician will direct. May he abundantly bless you and yours, and dear
_T―――― J――――_ and his? I send you all most hearty love, as being, for
CHRIST’s sake,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLIX.

                                           _London, January 8, 1762._

_My dear Timothy_,

I THOUGHT my wife had written many letters to you before this time.
Blessed be GOD, I am better. The _Scotch_ journey did me service.
I preached on new-year’s day, and am to do so again, GOD willing,
to-morrow. Who knows? who knows?――I may again see _Plymouth_. Is there
any thing too hard for the LORD? When can you come up? I had a violent
fall upon my head from my horse last _Thursday_, but was neither
surprized nor hurt. Help me to praise Him whose mercy endureth for ever.
Mr. _B――――_ is here, and preaches with power. Blessed be GOD that some
can speak, though I am laid aside. That your mouth may be opened, and
body strengthened more and more, is the hearty prayer of, my dear
_Timothy_,

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCLX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                           _Bristol, April 17, 1762._

WILL not my dear steady friend be glad to hear that _Bristol_ air
agrees with me, and that I have been enabled to preach five times this
last week without being hurt? LORD JESUS, make me truly and humbly
thankful! Was the door open for an _American_ voyage, I verily believe
it would be very serviceable towards bracing up my relaxed tabernacle.
But he who knoweth all things, knows what is best. Fain would I say,
from whatever quarter trials come, “Father, not my will, but thine be
done!” I see more and more, that grace must be tried. But this is our
comfort, when we are tried, we shall come forth like gold. In how many
fires is that precious metal purified? O for a heart to be willing
to be made willing to be nothing, yea less than nothing, that GOD,
even a GOD in CHRIST, may be all in all! You and yours will add to
my obligations by praying for me. By this you see that you are not
forgotten. Shall I beg you to let the tabernacle friends know soon,
that you received this? Having had company I cannot write. Be pleased
to thank the honest _Welch_ bishop for his subscription. It was a great
deal from such a dignitary. May the great Bishop of souls bless and
strengthen him in soul and body ever more. As I expect to hear from
my wife on _Monday_, and as I have nothing particular, I shall defer
writing again till _Monday_ evening. In the mean while, be so kind as
to give my hearty love and due respects to her and all, and accept the
same yourselves from, my very dear friends,

               Yours, &c. &c. in a never-failing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLXI.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                           _Bristol, April 18, 1762._

_My very dear Friend_,

I WAS quite sorry that I could not take a parting dinner with you. Mr.
_Z――――n_ begged me to come just at that time to converse with me about
the suffering protestants, and in the evening I read letters. Blessed
be GOD, I was not the worse for it. Since my coming here, my health
hath improved. The last week I was enabled to preach five times. This
morning I have been administering the ordinance; and this evening I
hope to be upon my throne again. Our LORD vouchsafes to smile upon
my feeble labours, and the people seem to feel a refreshing from his
divine presence. Who knows but I may yet be restored so far as to sound
the gospel trumpet for my GOD? The quietness I enjoy here, with daily
riding out, seems to be one very proper means. Be this as it will,
I know ere long I shall serve our LORD without weariness. A few more
blows from friends, and from foes, and the pitcher will be broken.
Then the wicked one will cease from troubling, and the weary traveller
arrive at his wish’d-for rest. GOD grant you and yours very large
refreshments in the way! Be pleased to accept of this as a token that
you are not forgotten by, my very dear friend,

              Yours, &c. under ten thousand obligations,
                        and in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLXII.

                                           _Bristol, April 29, 1762._

_My very dear Mr. D――――_,

HOW have I been contriving to come over in one of the mast ships lately
sailed for _New-England_? But the hour is not yet come. Hasten it, O
glorious _Emmanuel_, for thy great name’s sake! Surely a sea voyage
would help to brace up this relaxed tabernacle. Blessed be GOD, I am
now enabled to preach four or five times a week; but it is with much
weakness. I long to hear how it is with you in this _Spanish_ war. Mr.
_Robinson_ I find was cast away, but hath escaped with his life. Just
now I have seen a letter to Mrs. _P――――e_ from Mr. _H――――s_, by which
I find he is at _Bethesda_, and talks of returning to _England_. I hope
the _Spanish_ war will prevent this last motion, at least for some time.
My love to him and all. Persevere in praying me over. I have just now
heard, that there is a packet for me at _London_ from _Georgia_. How
could you draw on me for so large a sum as an hundred and forty-seven
pounds? LORD, help me! Yesterday at _Kingswood_ I saw the ship that
is to bring this, ready to sail. I hope I am not too late; and if any
letters come from any of you by this post (as I hear the _Carolina_
ships are arrived), GOD willing, they shall be answered by, my very
dear Mr. _D――――_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _Bristol, May 4, 1762._

_Dear Mrs. W――――_,

I THANK you heartily for your kind letter, and desire to bless the LORD
of all lords for the good news it contains. If the foot of pride doth
not come against those that speak for JESUS, all will be well. I see it
is always darkest before break of day. O that we could always remember
that blessed promise, “At evening-tide it shall be light.” The archers
have of late shot sorely at me and grieved me. _Job_’s friends were
his greatest trials, when GOD’s hand pressed his body sore. So it hath
been with me. But if we are brought out when tried like gold, we shall
only lose our dross. O that this may be my happy case! LORD, I believe;
help thou my unbelief! Blessed be his name for a little revival in
my bondage! For these three weeks past, I have been enabled to preach
four or five times. Not once without a special blessing. Join with me
in crying, Grace, grace! But my body still continues weak. O blessed
prospect of its being glorified by and by! Come, LORD JESUS, come
quickly! Continue to pray for me. Remember me most heartily to all, as
being, dear Mrs. _W――――_,

         Their and your most ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _Bristol, May 4, 1762._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

YOUR kind letter came to hand a few days ago. The convoy being driven
back, gives me an opportunity of returning you hearty thanks. Mr.
_R――――_’s draught will lie hard upon me; but I will endeavour to get it
paid. I am glad _A――――w_ and _G――――r_ are put out. It would have saved
me pounds to have had it done long ago. As it is war time, nobody can
blame you for lessening the family to the utmost. The intended change
at _Ephrata_ pleaseth me much. I see if we will wait, Providence will
open for us some way or another. O that the door was open for my coming
over! Perhaps it may be ere the Summer is over. Grant it, O GOD, for
JESUS CHRIST’s sake! I have sometimes the hopes of being braced up
again for a little future service. With some difficulty I preach four
or five times a week; but you would scarce know me, I am so swoln with
wind, and so corpulent. Blessed be GOD for the prospect of a glorious
resurrection! For the present, adieu. I fear the ship will be gone.
GOD bless you all. Pray do you and Mr. _D――――_ be particular in your
accounts. Hearty love to Mrs. _P――――l_: GOD comfort her. You will
shew this to Mr. _D――――_. I must add no more, but hearty love and ten
thousand thanks from, my dear friends,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                          _Rodborough, May 21, 1762._

_My very dear Friend_,

THOUGH I hope to be in _London_ on _Tuesday_ or _Wednesday_ next, yet
I cannot come thither without troubling you with another line. Blessed
be GOD, it leaves me in better bodily health, than when I wrote last.
Through divine mercy, preaching four or five times a week did not hurt
me; and twice or thrice I have been enabled to take the field: in my
opinion, a greater honour than to be monarch of the universe. _London_
cares, and _London_ labours, I expect, will soon bring me low again.
But as Messrs. _D――――_ and _K――――_ are coming up, I hope soon to slip
away and get strength, and then hunt for precious souls again. How
gladly would I bid adieu to cieled houses, and vaulted roofs! Mounts
are the best pulpits, and the heavens the best sounding-boards. O for
power equal to my will! I would fly from pole to pole, publishing the
everlasting gospel of the Son of GOD. I know you would lend me the
wings of prayer. JESUS in answer give the wings of faith and love, and
we shall then quickly soar to thy bosom, where

                Sin and strife and sorrow cease,
                And all is calm and joy and peace.

I write this at a house built for dear Mr. _A――――s_. From his window
is a prospect perhaps of thirty miles. I have wished you here with your
telescope. But if the footstool is so glorious, what must the throne
be? Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! I am interrupted by company. Good
night, my very dear friend, good night! Most cordial respects await
dear Mrs. _S――――_ and your daughter. Dear Mr. _A――――s_ is weak like
myself, but joins in sending due and hearty respects. We have had most
blessed seasons. Grace! grace! In heaven you will be rewarded for all
favours conferred on

                   Yours, &c. &c. in the best bonds,

_Dear Mrs. C――――._

I AM just now come to town for a few days, sensibly better by my
country excursion. Once more I have had the honour of taking the field,
and have now some hopes of not being as yet quite thrown aside as a
broken vessel. Help me to praise Him, whose mercy endureth for ever.
Why do you persist in keeping poor Mr. _D――――_ in suspense? If not done
before, I expect to marry you both immediately upon my arrival, but do
not stay for that. Your hint about Mr. _S――――_’s being inclined to the
ministry, made me smile. Mr. _R――――_’s account shall be paid as soon as
possible. But I beg no such thing may be done again. This is wrote in
very great haste, hearing that the ship is gone. I wrote to all from
_Bristol_, very lately. This must now do for all. GOD bless and reward
you. Amen and Amen! I am, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

THOUGH you never mentioned a word concerning the letter I sent you when
at _Bristol_, yet this doth not discourage me from dropping you a few
lines, now I am put into _Norwich-Dock_, in order to refit for another
expedition. The _Holland_ one last month, was, I trust, profitable
to myself and others; and if ever my usefulness is to be continued at
_London_, I must be prepared for it, by a longer itineration both by
land and water. At present, blessed be GOD, I can preach once a day,
and it would do your heart good to see what an influence attends the
word. All my old times are revived again. On next _Monday_, GOD willing,
I shall set forwards to _Lincolnshire_, _Yorkshire_, &c. You that
are in cieled houses, and under vaulted roofs (which I do not grudge
you) will not forget a poor pilgrim, who desires no other pulpit but a
mount, no other sounding board but the heavens. I hope dear Mr. _J――――_
is recovered of his indisposition, and that your wife and his, with
yourself, are increasing with all the increase of GOD. My cordial
respects and most hearty love attend you, and all that are so kind as
to enquire after a worthless worm. As I shall not write to-night, be
pleased to inform my wife that you heard of my welfare, and in so doing,
you will add to the obligations already laid upon, my very dear Mr.
_K――――n_,

                       Yours, &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLXVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. T――――._

                                      _Edinburgh, September 2, 1762._

I AM just this moment returned from _Glasgow_, where I have been
enabled to preach every day, and twice at _Cambuslang_. Auditories
were large, and JESUS smiled upon my feeble labours. GOD willing, I
shall leave this place on _Wednesday_ next; but I despair of seeing
you. I have heard nothing of Mr. _M――――n_ and _V――――n_ since I left
them at _Leeds_. What a mercy, that we are sure of meeting in heaven!
Surely, you will not go before me thither. Must it be always _juniores
priores_? Adieu. Cordial respects await your whole self. LORD JESUS be
with your spirits! I fear the carrier will be gone. Accept these few
rusty filings from, my very dear friend,

               Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our glorious JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                                       _September 9._

Thus far I went on _Friday_; but found that was the wrong day to send.
Since then, I have been helped to preach every day. The Kirk hath been
a _Bethel_. Grace! grace! On _Monday_, GOD willing, I shall set off.
Follow with your prayers.

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                                    _Sunderland, September 19, 1762._

_My dear Mr. D――――_,

I CAN only send you a few lines: but I hope they will be acceptable
ones. Your last packet came to my hands yesterday. Blessed be GOD that
all is so well! You will be glad to hear, that I can preach once a
day, and that I have now a prospect of embarking soon. We expect peace,
and I hope the places in _London_ will be provided for. Pray keep the
family as small as you can. Sickness lowers my circumstances. But JESUS
is all in all. I hope to see dear Mr. _S――――k_’s friends in a few days.
I am glad he is at _Ephrata_. Tender love to him and his, to dear Mrs.
_C――――_, Mrs. _P――――l_, and to all. I can no more. I write this at a
venture, to send by way of _Scotland_, where the Redeemer hath been
owning my feeble labours. Grace! grace! When I come to _London_, GOD
willing, you shall hear again from, my very dear friends,

                  Yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLXX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                         _Leeds, September 25, 1762._

_Dear Sir_,

WHAT a pity that I cannot answer your kind letter, by telling you where
to meet me! but it is impracticable. I am just now setting forwards
towards _London_, but fear I cannot reach it before _Sunday_. My chaise
wanted repairing here. O how good hath JESUS been to a worthless worm!
Once a day preaching, I can bear well; more hurts me. What shall I
do with the chapel and tabernacle? LORD JESUS, be thou my guide and
helper! He will! he will. Send word to tabernacle that you heard from
me. We have had sweet seasons. Grace! grace! To his never-failing
mercy do I commend your whole dear self, and all that are so kind as
to enquire after, my very dear friend,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLXXI.


                           _To Mrs. C――――._

                                          _London, October 15, 1762._

_Dear Mrs. C――――_,

I WISH to answer your last in person. I hope the time is now drawing
near. I count the weeks, and days, and hours. LORD JESUS, direct my
goings in thy way. Blessed be GOD that you live in such harmony! A
house thus united in JESUS, will stand. I shall bring only one Mr.
_W――――t_, who takes care of me. I would not have Mr. _H――――s_ to think
of stirring till he sees me. This I write in great haste. I am enabled
to preach once a day. Give thanks! give thanks! and continue to pray
for, dear Mrs. _C――――_,

                Yours, &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLXXII.


                         _To Mr. A―――― K――――._

                                         _Bristol, Numbers 29, 1762._

GOD willing, I shall set off for _Plymouth_ to-morrow morning, and
hope to see you all on _Thursday_ evening, or _Friday_. Let grand
preparations be made; as a candle, a book, and a table. Above all, much
prayer, that I may not again relapse at _Plymouth_; as _Bristol_ people
do threaten me for coming at this time of the year. Blessed be GOD, we
have good seasons. I like Mr. _B――――n_’s, better than a boarding school
for little maidens. A word to the wise is enough. Adieu! The LORD be
with you all. Cease not to pray for, my dear _Timothy_,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLXXIII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                        _Plymouth, December 4, 1762._

HOW was I disappointed, two _Mondays_, of seeing and conversing with
my very dear Mr. _S――――_! _London_, _London_, how dost thou weigh this
mortal body down! If it be no odds, I would visit my dear friend again
on a _Wednesday_. Perhaps on that day I may not be so fatigued. I feel
in preaching, what you do in business. However, I must not complain.
Once a day, I can manage quite well. _Bristol_ was a refreshing
place indeed. Congregations were very large, and a most gracious
gale of divine influences attended the word preached. Being under a
positive promise to come here before I left _England_, I embraced this
opportunity. Through mercy, I preached last night, and find no hurt
this morning. Many young people, I hear, are under great awakenings.
May such hostilities never cease! O to begin to begin to wage an
eternal war with the devil, the world, and the flesh. Still continue to
help me, dear Sir, with your prayers. I would fain die sword in hand.
You will not blame me for this ambition. I believe you are pretty much
tinctured this way yourself. The Captain of our salvation approves
of it. That in all your spiritual battles, He may be your shield and
exceeding great reward, is the hearty prayer of, my invaluable friend,

                   Yours, &c. &c. in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLXXIV.


                      _To Mrs. Elizabeth W――――d._

                                        _Plymouth, December 5, 1762._

YOU did very wrong, in not letting me know of your mother’s necessities.
She was a widow indeed. But now she is above the reach of every thing.
O for patience to wait till we are sent for to that place, where the
weary are at rest! I am weary of the world, of the church, and of
myself. But JESUS will not leave us in the latter stages of our road.
Blessed be his name, we have had pleasant seasons at _Bristol_, and two
good gales here. I cannot get up to _London_ till near _Christmas-day_.
As affairs are circumstanced, every thing there tends to weigh me down.
O that patience may have its perfect work! Let me always know your
wants. It is your own fault if you lack any thing, whilst I have a
farthing. You and your friend must prepare a great entertainment; for I
intend dining with you when I come to town. Ere long we shall sit down
and eat bread in our heavenly Father’s kingdom. Come, LORD JESUS, come
quickly! I know who joins in saying, Amen! with, my dear old faithful
friend and servant,

                     Yours, &c. for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCLXXV.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                        _Plymouth, December 5, 1762._

_My dear steady Friend_,

I MUST not be out of town, without sending my dear Mr. _K――――n_ a
few loving lines. Blessed be GOD for a few steady friends! they are
rarities even in the church of GOD. But the church is in a wilderness;
ere long it will be in _Canaan_. No briars or thorns there. All glory
be to Him who hath prepared such a rest for the purchase of his blood.
Amen. _Hallelujah!_ You will be glad to hear, that both here and at
_Bristol_, souls are under real awakenings. Though I preach in much
weakness, an infinitely condescending JESUS vouchsafes to come down
in glorious gales of his blessed Spirit. This is all in all. But these
are only streams. Ere long we shall drink at the fountain head. Do you
not long to leap your seventy years? Blessed be GOD, we are nearer and
nearer. Fly, fly, O time! welcome, welcome long wished for eternity!
But I must not enlarge. We are going to the LORD’s table. Adieu! Hearty
love awaits your whole self. In heaven I will thank you for all favours
conferred upon, my dear friend,

                    Yours in the Friend of sinners,

                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Bristol, December 12, 1762._

THROUGH divine mercy, we got here yesterday about three in the
afternoon, all well, excepting that I lost my watch in the way. If
it teacheth me to be more on my watch in the best things, it will be
rather a gain. LORD, help me in every thing to give thanks! I do not
repent my _Plymouth_ journey. Thanks to all for their great kindnesses.
Thanks, eternal thanks to the GOD of all, for giving us his presence!
It is better than life. I have not yet seen your daughter, but I
hear she is well. Tell _Sarah_ not to murder so dear a child. Hugging
to death is cruelty indeed. You will take the hint about my little
servitor. I charge you both, as you will answer it at the bar of GOD,
to teach them to be servant like, but not servile. Adieu! I must away
to sacrament. O for such a one as we had last _Sunday_! I felt, I felt
parting! O for the time when we shall part no more! Tender love to Mr.
_S――――_, his mother, brother, Mr. _D――――_, and all; your servants not
excepted. _Sarah_, adieu! Mind and get up in a morning to pray, before
you get into shop. I make no apology for this, because you are a friend
to, my dear man,

                    Yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

                                _Thursday evening. January 15, 1763._

_My dear Friend_,

DO meet me to-morrow by two o’clock, or rather one, at Mr. _B――――n_’s,
at _Cannonbury-house_. I have something of importance to communicate.
Not to keep you in suspense, it is to beseech you, jointly with Mr.
_H――――y_ and Mr. _B――――n_, as trustees, to take upon you the whole care,
both inward and outward, of the affairs of _Tottenham-court_ chapel
and tabernacle, and all other my concerns in _England_: this one thing
being settled, I have nothing to retard my visit to _America_, to which
I think there is a manifest call at this time, both as to the bracing
up my poor feeble crazy body, and adjusting all things relating to
_Bethesda_. O that the LORD may incline your heart to accept this
trust! It will take off this ponderous load that oppresses me much.
Consider, dear Sir, it is for GOD! for whose glory, I am convinced that
you and my other dear friends have a single eye and disinterested heart.
O may he richly reward you for this and all your labours of love! Fail
not of meeting me at the time and place above-mentioned. Mr. _H――――y_
and Mr. _H―――― D――――s_, GOD willing, will be there. The LORD JESUS be
with us all! My dear friend,

              Yours, &c. &c. indeed and indeed, in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCLXXVIII.

                                              _Leeds, March 6, 1763._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOU have heard, I suppose, of my progress to, and employ at _Everton_.
JESUS was there. Last _Thursday_ evening we came to these parts,
where I have preached twice, and been closely employed in writing my
little piece entitled, _Observations, &c._ in answer to the Bishop of
_Gloucester_. Perhaps a day or two more may compleat it. Say nothing,
but pray on. The next letters may be directed to _Edinburgh_, under
cover to _―――― H――――n_, Esq.; Post-Master general. You shall hear, GOD
willing, when I have fixed upon a ship. And I know you will pray that
JESUS may be my convoy.

                  Only Thou our leader be,
                  And we still will follow Thee.

I could enlarge, but must away to my throne. Tell all at Tabernacle
and Chapel, where this leaves me. I send them and your whole self
most tender love, and ten thousand thanks; and beg you would add to
my obligations by praying for, my very dear friend,

                  Yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._


                     POSTSCRIPT, _To Mr. J――――e_.

_My dear Sir_,

ACCEPT a few lines from an old friend that loves you and yours dearly.
I would not be given to change, but, like my Master, love to the end.
His blessing be on you both! Accept thanks unfeigned for all favours,
and cease not to pray for, my very dear Mr. _J――――_,

                          Yours, &c. in Ours,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCLXXIX.


                           _To Mrs. M――――._

                                         _Newcastle, March 13, 1763._

_Dear Mrs. M――――_,

IT hath given me concern, since I left town, that through bodily
weakness, multiplicity of business, and pain of parting, I forgot to
answer your request about your deceased son. If not too late, something
like this may be inserted:

  “Near this place lies interred, _William Middleditch_, aged
  twelve years, a desirable promising child; but an all-wise GOD
  thought proper to remove him ――――, 1762. His surviving parents
  desire to subscribe to the divine will, and to say, The LORD
  gave, and the LORD hath taken away: blessed be the name of the
  LORD.”

Ere long somebody will be writing an epitaph for our tombs. Change of
place doth not change my sentiments. “Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly,”
is the constant language of my heart. This leaves me thus far advanced
towards _Scotland_, where just such a ship as I want awaits me. How
good is JESUS! Fain would I sing,

                      LORD, obediently I go,
                      Gladly leaving all below.

I am sorry to find by the papers that Mr. _B――――_ is taken up. To take
no notice would be the best method. A prison or outward punishment is
but a poor cure for enthusiasm, or a disordered understanding. It may
increase but not extinguish such an _ignis fatuus_. LORD JESUS, give us
all a right judgment in all things! Farewell. Brethren, pray for us. We
have had pleasant seasons at _Everton_, _Leeds_, _Aberford_, _Kippax_,
and here. Tender love to all that are so kind as to enquire after
a worthless worm. That you may be so supplied as not to miss me one
moment, is the earnest prayer of, dear Mrs. _M――――_,

       Your sincere friend and ready servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I CANNOT go further, without dropping you a few lines. They leave me
thus far advanced in my journey to _Scotland_. My friends write me word,
that the ship _Jenny_, Captain _Orr_, a very discreet person, sails
from _Greenock_ to _Boston_ the middle of _April_. You will pray, that
the GOD of the sea and dry land will give me a safe, and, if agreeable
to his will, a speedy passage. On the road we have been favoured with
some sweet seasons. I have preached at _Everton_, _Leeds_, _Kippax_,
_Aberford_, and this place. Next sabbath I hope to be at _Edinburgh_.
On my way, I was enabled to finish a little thing in answer to the
present Bishop of _Gloucester_. If my friends think proper to print
it, you will find a parting testimony left behind me for the good old
Puritans and free-grace Dissenters, whom he sadly maligns. Bless it,
glorious _Emmanuel_, and it shall be blessed! Follow me, follow me,
my very dear Sir, with your constant prayers. Mine will always be
ascending for you and yours. Indeed I owe you much love! You have often
strengthened my hands in the LORD. Fain would I sing,

                    LORD, obediently I go,
                    Gladly leaving all below;
                    Only Thou my leader be,
                    And I still will follow Thee.

And now, my dear friend, farewell. Ere long we shall meet in a better
climate, where

                Pain and sin and sorrow cease,
                And all is calm and joy and peace.

Most cordial respects await dear Mrs. _S――――_ and your daughter, if
continued in this dying world. Expect to hear, from time to time, from,
my very dear Sir,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Mrs. W――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, March 19, 1763._

_Dear Mrs. W――――_,

I WAS quite concerned to see you so ill as I passed by you. I charge
you to want for nothing. Speak to Messrs. _K――――n_ or _H――――y_: they
will supply you at any time. Do not be afraid to go to the Tabernacle
house. I will own and stand by my dear steady and faithful servants and
helpers. Such a one you have been. O for heaven! There are no thorns
and briars amongst GOD’s people there. May our present ones fit us more
and more for that place where

                Sin and strife and sorrow cease,
                And all is calm and joy and peace.

Follow me with your prayers. Tender love to all the conference. I have
no doubt of the LORD’s being with them. GOD be with you all evermore!
We have had good seasons at _Everton_, _Leeds_, _Newcastle_, &c. in the
way. Grace! grace! In about a month I expect to sail. A good stock of
prayers in that time, may be laid up for, dear _Betty_, my old faithful
friend and servant,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _Edinburgh, March 26, 1763._

_My dear Friend_,

WHY not see each other once more? Perhaps, after my return from
_Glasgow_, I may be here a fortnight. My poor tabernacle is so far
restored, as to mount the gospel throne once a day. Perhaps the sea
air may brace me up a little more: but after all, it is only like the
glimmering of a candle before it goes out. Death will light it up in a
better world. Work on, my dear son, work on. The night cometh when no
man can work. O that I had done more for the blessed JESUS! O that I
could think more of what he hath done for me! Never mind being counted
singular. O that you may be more and more vile every day! Happy they
that are safe landed!

                  ――――――――And happy, happy we,
                  Who soon their company shall see!

It is but _for a little indeed_. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! I know
you will heartily say, _Amen_. Cordial respects await Mrs. _T――――_. The
_Edinburgh_ prescriptions were the most blessed to me. My spirits are
much brisker than when here last. Grace! grace! O to lie low! Adieu, my
dear friend.

                Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

I THANK you for your kind letter, and thank the LORD ♦of all lords that
matters go on so well. I am more than easy. The Redeemer hath directed
my choice, and will bless, assist, and reward those employed. Ten
thousand thanks to you all. You may act as you please with respect to
Mr. ――――. His attending the Tabernacle when I was well, and leaving
it ever since I have been sick, doth not look well at all: but please
yourselves and you will please me. Do not consult me in any thing,
unless absolutely necessary. The LORD, I trust and believe, will give
you a right judgment in all things. But O follow me with your prayers.
On _Monday_ I am going to see about the ship. Now we have peace abroad,
LORD JESUS give us peace at home! I am sorry my little piece, entituled
_Observations_, &c. is not come out yet. Tender love to all. My dear
old friend,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mr. W――――y_,

I THANK you for your kind remembrance in Mr. _W――――_’s. Indeed I do
not forget you. O that you may be a steady follower of Him, who was not
ashamed of being called the carpenter’s son! My prayer to him is, that
you may be daily more and more built up in his most holy faith. But
the way to heaven is a narrow way. No elbow room for our lusts. What
a blessing this! LORD JESUS, make us willing to be made whole! Adieu.
Tender love to all enquiring friends. I trust their prayers are heard.
The Redeemer vouchsafes to smile upon the feeble labours of, my dear
Mr. _W――――y_,

                          Yours, &c. in Him,

_My dear old steady Friend_,

WHY so fearful of writing a longer letter? The longer the better.
Blessed be GOD, though disappointed in embarking, by reason of sickness,
I can read, and write, and hope (notwithstanding a little cold, which
threw me somewhat back this week) soon to get upon my throne again. The
news about the congregations, you may well guess rejoiced my poor heart.
Surely Mr. _H――――_ will not get to heaven before me too. What an age do
we live in! Children thus to take the lead of their parents. Heavenly
Father, not my will, but thine be done! I expect to-morrow’s interview.
A single eye will carry us through all. A catholic spirit is the plague
of bigots. LORD JESUS, cure them of their bad distemper! I rejoice to
hear that good Lady _H――――n_ is so supported. Pray remember me in the
kindest manner to dear Mr. _H――――y_. As I have not heard from him for
two or three posts, I fear he is worse. Pray let him know of my sending
this; and inform him of my having been able to go upon the water to-day
for several hours, and by land afterwards. Others can die, but I cannot.
Father, thy will be done! What a GOD do I serve? Physicians, friends
on every side of me. And what is all in all, the great physician
comforting my soul. Thank, O thank him in behalf of a worthless worm.
Tender love to Mrs. _K――――n_, Mr. and Mrs. _B――――n_, Mr. and Mrs.
_J――――_, and all dear friends, who are so kind as to be concerned
for me. You will be very fine when all is painted. Blessed be GOD,
I approve your conduct, and love your spirit. LORD JESUS, make us
all glorious within! I must drop a line to dear Mr. _A――――_ about
Mr. _H――――_, or you should have more from, my dear old steady friend,

                     Yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

_My dear Friend_,

A THOUSAND thanks for your kind letters. JESUS is kind. I am better,
and just going on board the _Fanny_, bound to _Rapanach_, in _Virginia_.
Yours to good Lady _H――――n_ is taken care of. I hear her daughter died
well, and that her Ladyship is comforted and resigned. Blessed be GOD!
Adieu. Follow me with your prayers, as being

                            Ever yours, &c.

STRANGE! that I should not see one whom I so dearly love. Dear Mr.
_S――――_ will tell you the reasons. I expect to be called every moment.
GOD bless and reward you and yours. The diploma was sent to _Edinburgh_
to be signed by Mr. _Trail_, but hath miscarried. I wrote to Mr.
_Hamilton_ to send it by the _Diligence_, which is to sail in about
six weeks to _Boston_. Expecting to be called every moment, I can only
hasten to subscribe myself, reverend and very dear Sir,

                     Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _At Sea, July 15, 1763._

_My very dear Friend_,

I HOPE that this will find you and yours prospering both in soul and
body. It leaves me looking towards _Virginia_ but only as an harbour
in my way to an infinitely better port, from whence I shall never put
out to sea again. Through mercy I have been surprizingly kept up during
the voyage, long but not tedious. JESUS hath made the ship a _Bethel_,
and I enjoyed that quietness which I have in vain sought after for some
years on shore. Not an oath to be heard even in the greatest hurry.
All hath been harmony and love. But my breath is short, and I have
little hopes, since my late relapse, of much further public usefulness.
A few exertions, like the last struggles of a dying man, or glimmering
flashes of a taper just burning out, is all that can be expected from
me. But blessed be GOD, the taper will be lighted up again in heaven.
The sun, when setting here, only sets to rise in another clime. Such is
the death of all GOD’s saints. Why then should we be afraid? Why should
we not rather by faith be looking through the windows of mortality,
and daily crying, “Why are his chariot wheels so long in coming?” We
had need of patience, especially when the evil days of sickness and
declining age come. But we serve a Master who will not forsake his
servants when grey headed. When heart and flesh fail, GOD, even our GOD
in CHRIST, will be our portion and confidence for ever. Does my dear
Mr. _S――――_ repent that he served and worked for Him when young? Is
dear Mrs. _S――――_ sorrowful that he was the GOD of her youth? Or is
Miss now thinking that she hath lately made a wrong choice? No, no:
I will venture to answer for them all. Let us, therefore, love our
Master, and not go from him. Who knows but our latter end may yet
increase? If not in public usefulness, LORD JESUS, let it be in inward
heart-holiness, that we may daily ripen for the full enjoyment of
thyself in heaven! I know who says, _Amen_; I add _Amen_, and _Amen_!
and so subscribe myself, with ten thousand thanks for all favours, my
dear friends,

                     Yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._


                                                         _August 24._

_P. S._ Since writing the above, we have been exercised by contrary
winds, thunders, lightenings, &c. but out of all the LORD hath brought
us, and we came within the _Cape_ last night. Help me to praise him, O
my friends.

                             _Within Virginia-Cape, August 24, 1763._

_My dear Mr. P――――ks_,

I FULLY purposed to write to you before my embarkation for _America_,
but sickness prevented. However, I dearly love you, and often remember
you before his throne, who I am persuaded hath loved and given himself
for you. This he hath told you, and assured you of again and again by
his blessed word and Spirit. Be not therefore faithless, but believing.
O that this may find you rejoicing with that joy which is unspeakable
and full of glory. It leaves me longing for that blissful state, where
sorrow and sighing will flee away. There, there shall we meet, and in
spite of all the suggestions of Satan, and the desperate wickedness of
our own deceitful hearts, ere long join in singing the song of _Moses_
and the Lamb. Faithful is he that hath promised, who also will do it.
Last night, but not till then, we cast anchor after near a twelve weeks
passage. The last six weeks were very trying to my shattered bark. But
JESUS is All in All. Help, help to praise him. To his infinite and
never-failing mercy do I commend you, as being, for his great name’s
sake, my dear Mr. _P――――ks_,

                      Yours most affectionately,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCXC.


             _To all my dear Tabernacle Hearers, that love
                 the LORD JESUS CHRIST in Sincerity_.

                                       _Virginia, September 1, 1763._

_Dearly Beloved in the_ LORD,

THOUGH absent in body, the Searcher of hearts knows that I have been
present with you in spirit ever since I left _London_. Glad, very glad
was I to hear from time to time whilst ashore, that the shout of a king
was among you; and it was my continual prayer whilst at sea, that the
glory of the LORD may so fill the Tabernacle, that all who come to hear
the word, may be constrained to say, “Surely GOD is in this place.”
I doubt not of your wrestling in my behalf. Certainly it must be in
answer to your cryings unto the LORD, that I have been dealt with so
bountifully. For some weeks I was enabled to preach once a day when
in _Scotland_, and I trust not without some divine efficacy. But my
late disorder kept me silent for some weeks afterwards, and put me upon
thinking sometimes, that my intended voyage would be retarded, at least
for one year longer. Having obtained a little more bodily strength,
I ventured upon the mighty waters, and thanks, eternal thanks to
a never-failing Redeemer, I have not been laid by an hour through
sickness since I came on board. Every thing hath been providentially
ordered, suitable to my low estate. A large and commodious cabbin, a
kind Captain, and a most orderly and quiet ship’s company, who gladly
attended when I had breath to preach. Scarce an oath have I heard upon
deck, during a twelve weeks voyage; and such a stillness through the
whole ship, both on week days and the Lord’s-day, as hath from time
to time surprized me. Some concern hath appeared, but of what kind or
duration the event alone can discover. The spiritual bread hath been
cast on the waters: who knows but it may be found after many days. How
it shall please my all-bountiful Master to dispose of me when I get on
shore, you shall know hereafter. All that I can say is, (if I know any
thing of my unspeakably deceitful, and desperately wicked heart) LORD
JESUS,

                A life that all things casts behind,
                Springs forth obedient to thy call;
                A heart, that no desire can move,
                But still t’adore, resign, and love,
                Give me, my LORD, my life, my all!

You will not forget to persevere in praying for a poor, worthless,
but willing pilgrim, who dearly loves you, and daily rejoices in the
pleasing reflection, that he shall ere long meet you in a better world,
where the inhabitants shall no more say, “I am sick.” Blessed prospect!
Surely on the very mentioning it, you will break forth in singing,

                  _Rejoice, the LORD is king, &c._

I will not interrupt you. Adieu. The LORD JESUS be with your spirits.
Only when you have done singing, my dear fellow-labourers, my dear
Tabernacle-hearers, forget not to subjoin at least one petition, that
whether absent or present, JESUS may be more and more precious to,

            Your affectionate friend, and willing servant,
                      for his great name’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

                   LORD JESUS CHRIST in Sincerity_.

                                       _Virginia, September 1, 1763._

_Dearly Beloved in the LORD_,

THOUGH less than the least of all, and unworthy, utterly unworthy the
notice of any, yet I cannot help thinking, but for CHRIST’s sake you
will be glad to hear of the goodness of the LORD extended towards me
since my departure from _London_. Surely it was trying, to leave so
many at each end of the town, who, I hope, will be my joy and crown
of rejoicing in the great day. Indeed, after being taken ill of my
old disorder at _Edinburgh_, and remaining near six weeks silent in
_Scotland_, I thought of seeing you soon again: but having obtained
help, I embarked, for the eleventh time, in the ship _Fanny_; and
though we have had a long and trying, yet, blessed be GOD, it hath not
been an unprofitable voyage. Often, often have I thought of my dear
_London_ friends, when I guessed they were assembled together; and
as often prayed, when I knew they were retired to rest, that he that
keepeth _Israel_, and neither slumbereth nor sleepeth, would watch over
them, and make their very dreams devout. How I am to be disposed of
when on dry land, is best known to Him whose I am, and whom I desire to
serve in preaching the gospel of his dear Son. Had I strength equal to
my will, I could fly from pole to pole. Though wearied, and now almost
worn out, indeed and indeed I am not weary of my blessed Master’s
service. O love him, love him, for he is a good Master, and doth not
leave us when our strength faileth. Make him your portion, and he will
be your confidence for ever. According to my present views, if able to
do any thing for you, through his leave I hope to see you again next
year. In the mean while, as long as I have breath to draw, it shall
be my heart’s desire and prayer to GOD, that the labours of the dear
servants of JESUS, who are called to preach amongst you, may be so
blessed and owned from above, that I may not be missed a single moment.
May they, may you increase with all the increase, till you are all
filled with all the fulness of GOD. When near his throne, if there be
any consolation in CHRIST, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of
the Spirit, if any bowels of mercies, pray that the same blessing may
be conferred, my dear fellow-labourers, my dear _Tottenham-Court_
hearers, on

               Your most affectionate friend, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Mr. A――――_,

MANY more letters did I intend to write to you and other dear friends,
had I not been prevented by storms, &c. for some weeks before our
arrival. If enabled, I shall take care to pay them as I move from
place to place. We are now on dry land. Christian friends, whom I never
before heard of, were prepared to receive me: and I have preached four
times. This leaves me in my way to _Philadelphia_, still visited with
my old disorder, which I now never expect to drop, till I drop for good
and all this body of clay, this body of sin and death. I suppose you
are in like circumstances, as well as thousands besides, who love the
LORD JESUS in sincerity. Well: He that cometh will come, and will not
tarry. Blessed are all they that wait for him. I hope you are favoured
with precious gales of divine influence. Tender love to all our dear
fellow-labourers, and to all our dear hearers of every denomination,
in every place. You will not forget a poor pilgrim, who, though absent
in body is present in spirit. Hoping to write in a few days to dear
Mr. _Middleton_, &c. and wishing you and yours all that a blessed
never-failing GOD can give you in time and eternity, I subscribe myself,
my very dear old friend,

              Ever yours, &c. in our precious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. W――――y_,

_EBENEZER!_ Hitherto the LORD hath helped! I have been here above a
week; but still an invalid.

              Strange, that a harp of thousand strings
              Should keep in tune so long!

Poor _Wright_ is taking his _American_ seasoning. He hath the ague and
fever. This prevents his writing. Inform his relations of it. He wants
for nothing. When you write, mention nothing but what relates to the
eternal world. I have no thoughts to throw away on the trifling things
of time. Tender love to all that are travelling to the _New-Jerusalem_.
There, if no sooner, we shall meet and praise the never-failing
_Emmanuel_, for whose great name’s sake I subscribe myself,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXCIV.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                    _Philadelphia, October 21, 1763._

_My very dear Mr. K――――n_,

THE bearer, Mr. _R――――d_, is a young sober gentleman, intended for the
temple, and will be very glad to see and hear Mr. _Romaine_, and other
gospel ministers. I hope all are flaming for GOD, even a GOD in CHRIST.
Here are some young bright witnesses rising up in the church. Perhaps
I have already conversed with forty new-creature ministers of various
denominations. Sixteen hopeful students, I am credibly informed, were
converted at _New-Jersey_ college, last year. What an open door, if I
had strength! But――Father, thy will be done! blessed be His name, I can
preach now and then. Last _Tuesday_ we had a remarkable season among
the _Lutherans_. Children and grown people were much impressed. Grace!
grace! If possible, I intend returning with Mr. _H――――m_ (now here)
to _Georgia_. You will hear the determination by the next ship, that
goes very soon. I wrote to dear Mr. _H――――y_ very lately, by way of
_Bristol_. Tender, tender love to him, and to all. I have scarce time
to beg the continued interest of all your prayers, in behalf of, my
dear steady old friend,

                       Yours, &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXCV.


                          _To Mr. D――――, &c._

                                    _Philadelphia, November 8, 1763._

_My very dear Friends_,

MAN appoints, GOD for wise reasons disappoints. All was ready for my
coming by land to you at _Bethesda_, with Mr. _H――――m_; but several
things concurred to prevent me, and the physicians all agree, that the
only chance I have for growing better, is to stay and see what the cold
weather will do for me. Fain would I say, however it may cross my will,
_Father, thy will be done_! At present, I make a shift to preach twice
a week. But alas, my strength is perfect weakness. What a mercy that
JESUS is all in all! You will let me hear from you very particularly,
by Captain _Bolitha_, or any other opportunity, either to this place
or _New-York_. I want to know the present state of all your affairs
in every respect. Surely the blessed _Emmanuel_, who hath brought me
thus far, will give us an interview by and by. That it may be a very
happy one here below, and a prelude to an infinitely more happy and
never-ceasing one above, is the hearty prayer of, my very dear friends,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXCVI.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                   _Philadelphia, November 14, 1763._

_My dear old Friend_,

THIS comes by one Mr. _R――――_, reputed to be a real christian and an
expert tradesman, but greatly afflicted with a nervous head-ach. He
will be glad of some spiritual acquaintance. Fain would he have had
me under his roof. I wish he may get help, but I think we have got our
life warrant. Mr. _Cruttenden_ I find is released; and a dear minister
of _New-York_ got free on _Saturday_. I am here yet, left behind, and
now about to make my first excursion to the _New-Jersey_ college. Twice
a week preaching, is my present allowance. Many of various ranks seem
to be brought under real concern. Physicians are absolutely against my
going to _Georgia_, till I get more strength. Besides, it is doubtful
whether the southern _Indians_ will not break out, and therefore a
little stay in these parts may on that account be most prudent. LORD
JESUS, direct my goings in thy way! Accept my wonted general salutation;
tender love to all. You and yours will not cease to pray for, my dear
steady friend,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCXCVII.


                         _To Mr. D――――n, &c._

                                 _Elizabeth-Town, November 26, 1763._

_My very dear Friends_,

HOW is this? Am I come four thousand miles to winter with you, and like
to be disappointed at last? I fear so; for alas, only by travelling
thus far from _Philadelphia_ in my way to _New-York_, I am quite
fatigued. But I do not despair yet, if GOD gives me any strength. Pray
hard, and who knows what a GOD may do? Dear Mr. _H――――m_ will best
acquaint you with northern particulars. He leaves me this morning, but
I hope to see him at _New-York_ the beginning of the week, and to write
more. O that I may come with him! Abba, Father, all things are possible
with thee! Adieu! My dear friend is going. Cease not to pray for, and
write to,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCXCVIII.


                                        _New-York, December 1, 1763._

_My dear Sir_,

HOW thankful should I be to the adorable JESUS, and to all that love me
for his great name’s sake, for the blessed contents of your last, dated
_September 10_. Praise the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within
me praise his holy name! May this be only an earnest of good things
to come, both in _England_ and _Wales_. Ere now, I suppose dear Mr.
_Davis_ is crying _Gogunniant_ in _London_. We are essaying to echo
it back from _America_. Some very good impressions have been made in
_Philadelphia_, and we had four sweet seasons at _New-Jersey_ college,
and two at _Elizabeth-Town_, in my way hither. Some said they resembled
old times. My spirits grow better. But thrice a week is as often as I
can preach. To-day I begin here, and have thoughts of returning with Mr.
_H――――m_ to _Georgia_, but am fearful of relapsing by such a fatiguing
passage or journey. The LORD will direct. Mr. _Cruttenden_ is got above
these infirmities; GOD be praised that he went off so comfortably!
may our expiring hour be like his! Surprized am I indeed to find that
you have a little one coming into this world which others are leaving.
LORD JESUS, spare root and branch, for thy own glory, and thy people’s
good! LORD JESUS, convert us all more and more, and make us all like
little children! Tender, tender love to all that love him in sincerity.
I would write to many more, but company, low state of health, and
travelling, render more frequent writing impracticable to, my dear
steady friend,

                 Yours, theirs, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._


                                              _New-York, December 4._

SINCE writing the above, blessed be GOD, I have preached. Persons of
all denominations seem to be athirst. Grace! grace! Desire dear Mr.
_H――――y_ to look into the _Universal History of Arts and Sciences_,
volume the second, page 436, for an account of Methodism, by a papist.
GOD bless you all. Amen and Amen. I am just now told that the ship is
going. Several other opportunities of writing will soon offer, which,
GOD willing, shall be embraced by, my dear steady friend,

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCXCIX.


                         _To Mr. D――――n, &c._

                                        _New-York, December 7, 1763._

_My very dear Friends_,

WHAT a mortification do you think it must be to me, to part thus from,
and not to accompany my dear Mr. _H――――m_ to _Bethesda_? Thus it was
near twenty years ago, and yet I came, though he left me so ill at
_New-England_. Assure yourselves, I shall come as soon as possible. In
the mean while, I have desired Mr. _H――――m_ to assist in supervising
and settling the accompts, and to give his advice in respect to the
house, plantation, &c. &c. I beg you will be so good as to let me
have an inventory of every individual thing, the names and number of
the negroes, and what you think is necessary to be done every way. I
would only observe in general, that I would have the family lessened
as much as may be, and all things contracted into as small a compass
as possible. And now once more adieu, though I trust but for a short
season. My heart is too full to enlarge. I have not got the account of
the children taken in since the first institution; it is left I believe
in _New-England_. I purpose going thither now from the southward. But
it will be better to go to heaven. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! Dear
Mr. _H――――m_ will inform you of all particulars concerning the gospel
ministrations of, my very dear friends,

                 Yours, ever yours, &c. &c. in CHRIST,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCC.


                           _To Mr. H――――y._

                                        _New-York, December 8, 1763._

_Dear Sir_,

BLESSED be GOD, I am enabled to preach thrice a week. But such a
flocking of all ranks, I never before saw at _New-York_. A great number
have been to see me, and several come to me in the evening, as it
should seem, to hear something of the kingdom of GOD. My stay here is
undetermined. Perhaps it may be till _Christmas_. Many thanks are due
to my _London_ friends, for their kind assistance, from time to time,
in carrying on outward matters, and particularly to those who were so
ready to assist in compleating the tabernacle job in such an honourable
way. All with you will continue to pray for me. I would write more,
but amidst such a throng of company and bodily weakness, it is indeed
impracticable. I now repeatedly send all my tender love; and still
praying that all may be filled with all the fulness of GOD, I beg leave
to subscribe myself,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCCI.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                       _New-York, December 16, 1763._

_My very dear Friend_,

I SEE by what you have done lately for the tabernacle, that you do not
forget absent friends. I think you and yours are not forgotten by them,
neither I believe are forgotten by the Friend of all. He remembers us,
though he is advanced to so great a kingdom; remembers us in our low
estate, and remembers that we are but dust. What a blessing this to
worthless, ill and hell-deserving me! What a mercy, to meet with such
a friend in the latter stages of our road! Surely he is altogether
lovely. Having loved his own, he loves them to the end; witness his
yet continuing to own the feeble labours of an almost worn out pilgrim.
Every day the thirst for hearing the word increases, and the better
sort come home to hear more of it. I must now go soon to _New-England_.
Cold weather and a warm heart suit my tottering tabernacle best. The
ship is going. GOD bless you and yours! I hope that all related, and
all who are near and dear to you, are alive for GOD,――a GOD,――a GOD in
CHRIST; in whose great name, I beg leave to subscribe myself, my very
dear friend,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                    _New-York, Deuteronomy 18, 1763._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

BLESSED be GOD, I am better in health than when I wrote last. Preaching
thrice a week agrees pretty well with me this cold season of the year.
I am apt to believe my disorder will be periodical. It was so with
Mr. _Postwick_, who is now with GOD. Our turn must come by and by.
Who would have thought Mr. _Robert Scot_ would have went off so soon?
LORD, what is man? O to be always ready! O for thousands to go forth
to alarm a drowsy world! _New-Jersey_ college is a blessed nursery; one
of the purest perhaps in the universe. The worthy President and three
tutors, are all bent upon making the students both saints and scholars.
I was lately there for a week. The Redeemer vouchsafed to own the word
preached. Some said it was like old times. Prejudices in this place
have most strangely subsided. The better sort flock as eagerly as the
common people, and are fond of coming for private gospel conversation.
This is all of grace. O for an humble and thankful heart! Perhaps I may
soon go to _Boston_. I know you will pray that the glorious _Emmanuel_
may accompany me in all my removes. That this may be the happy lot
of your whole self, and of all dear enquiring friends, is the hearty
prayer of, reverend and very dear Sir,

                   Yours, theirs, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ I wrote to Mr. _Niven_ last week.




                            LETTER MCCCIII.


                         _To Mr. D――――n, &c._

                                        _New-York, January 12, 1764._

_My very dear Friends_,

CAPTAIN _Bolitho_ is returned, and not one line from _Bethesda_! Surely
you were not informed of his sailing, or you expected to see me with
Mr. _H――――m_. That which lets will surely by and by be taken out of the
way. Blessed be GOD, the cold braces me up a little. I am enabled to
preach twice or thrice a week. Congregations continue very large, and
I trust saving impressions are made upon many. Some students also in
_Philadelphia_ and _New Jersey_ colleges, I hear are much awakened.
O for a blessed gale of divine influences when we meet at _Bethesda_!
From thence, or _Charles-Town_, I purpose to embark for _England_. But
future things belong to Him, who (whatever may be our thoughts) always
orders all things well. To his never-failing guidance and most tender
mercy do I commit you all, as being, for his great name’s sake, my very
dear friends,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCIV.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                             _Boston, March 3, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

AS I find by letters from my wife and Mr. _T―――― C――――_, dated in
_October_ and _November_, and by another from Mr. _D――――t_, dated in
_December_, that my friends had heard from me more than once, I was in
hopes of receiving a few lines from you by the last _New-York_ packet.
But I suppose you thought I was gone to the southward. Providence
shut up my way: I believe for wise reasons. The inclosed will let you
see how matters went at _New-York_. Since leaving that place, a sweet
influence hath attended the word at _Easthampton_, _Bridgehampton_,
and _South-hold_ upon _Long-Island_, at _Shelter-Island_ also, and
at _New-London_, _Norwich_, and ♦_Providence_ on the main land. At
_Boston_ I have been received with the usual warmth of affection. Twice
have we seen the Redeemer’s stately steps in the great congregation.
But as the small-pox is likely to take an universal spread through the
town, I purpose making my country tour, and then return to _Boston_ in
my way to the southward. Invitations come so thick and fast from every
quarter, that I know not what to do. I cannot boast of acquiring much
additional bodily strength, any otherwise than as the cool season of
the year helps to keep me up. Twice a week is as often as I can with
comfort ascend my throne. The Redeemer vouchsafes to speak for himself
there, and private conversation is greatly blessed. Thus the taper
keeps burning a little longer: when extinguished on earth, it will be
removed where it shall burn with uninterrupted lustre in the kingdom
of heaven. Till I hear from you, and see what is determined concerning
_Bethesda_, I cannot think of undertaking a long voyage. Sometimes I
fear my weakness will never allow me to go on ship-board any more. But
I will wait. I will endeavour to watch and pray, and doubt not but I
shall hear a voice behind me saying, “This is the way, walk thou in
it.” In the mean while, I rejoice to find that dear Mr. _Davis_ is come
to his winter quarters, and do earnestly pray night and day, that he
and all my dear fellow-labourers and hearers may increase with all the
increase of GOD. Perhaps they may pray me over once more. Whenever the
way is clear, I am ready to say, “LORD JESUS, lo I come.” Tender, most
tender love awaits you all. I must not enlarge, lest my affections
should overpower this feeble frame. In heaven it will be otherwise.
My very dear Sir, farewel. I must away to preach at _Charles-Town_, a
neighbouring town to _Boston_. Hoping ere long to join with you all in
praising GOD for evermore, I beg leave to subscribe myself,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                     _Concord, 20 miles from Boston, March 10, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

SINCE my last I suppose you have heard one way or another of my being
in this dying world, and in some measure improved for propagating the
glorious gospel. _New York_ was _New-York_ indeed. We saw blessed days
of the Son of Man there. Since that, in my way to these parts, a divine
influence attended the word preached in various places. And how would
you have been delighted to have seen Mr. _Wheelock_’s Indians? Such a
promising nursery of future missionaries, I believe was never seen in
_New-England_ before: pray encourage it with all your might. I also
wish you could give some useful puritanical books to _Harvard-college_
library, lately burnt down. Few perhaps will give such; and yet a
collection of that kind is absolutely necessary for future students and
poor neighbouring ministers, to whom I find the books belonging to the
library are freely lent out from time to time. You will not be angry
with me for these hints. I know your ambitious greedy soul: you want
to grow richer and richer towards GOD. O that there may be in me such
a mind! But my wings are clipped. I can only preach twice or thrice a
week with comfort. And yet a wider door than ever is opened all along
the continent. A beginning is made in _Boston_. But as the small-pox
is spreading there, I purpose preaching for a while in adjacent places.
With what success, you may know hereafter. I send you and yours these
few lines as a token of gratitude, respect, and love unfeigned; but
must still beg you to add to my obligations, by continuing to pray for,
my very dear friends,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCVI.


                        _To C―――― H――――y, Esq._

                                        _Portsmouth, March 23, 1764._

_Very dear Sir_,

HOW was my heart eased by receiving yesterday your kind letter, dated
_October 22d_? If you and dear Mr. _K――――n_ will continue to manage
when I am present, as well as when I am absent, it may give another
turn to my mind. Who knows what a never-failing GOD may do in a few
months! At present, my way is clear to go on preaching till I can
journey southward. The inclosed will inform you what hath been done by
one sermon at _Providence_, formerly a most ungodly place, forty miles
south of _Boston_. At _Newbury_, which I left yesterday, is a stir
indeed. On Lord’s-day I shall begin here. O for daily fresh gales! That
they may every day more and more increase with you and all your dear
relations, and all dear friends, is the hearty prayer of, very dear Sir,
in great haste, but greater love,

                     Yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCVII.


                           _To Mrs. M――――h._

                                        _Portsmouth, March 30, 1764._

_Dear Mrs. M――――h_,

I HAVE just now heard of your loss. Accept a few sympathizing lines.
I hope those that are dead, died in the LORD: if so, we had need weep
only for ourselves and for children that are left behind. You are now
more at liberty for the Redeemer’s work. I need wish you no greater
honour than that you may be _a widow indeed_. Though desolate, she puts
her trust in the LORD, and she continues in prayer night and day. This
hath been your old employ. By and by you shall have nothing to do but
praise.

                O glorious seat! Our GOD our king,
                Us thither bring, to kiss thy feet.

I hope ere now, that many more in the neighbouring market have thus
begun their heaven upon earth. I hear GOD is with you at the chapel.
Praise the LORD, O my soul! You will know from others, what cheer the
Redeemer gives us in _America_. Good cheer, Mrs. _M――――h_, good cheer.
He rains down righteousness; he rains down bread from heaven on the
congregations. This supports (and at times overcomes) my tottering
tabernacle. In heaven we shall have a glorious body. Hoping and
believing that yourself and sister, Mr. and Mrs. _K――――g_, and Mr. and
Mrs. _W――――_, with many others, will speedily meet there, I subscribe
myself, dear Mrs. _M――――h_,

                Yours, theirs, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCVIII.


                       _To Mr. and Mrs. D――――n._

                                            _Boston, April 20, 1764._

_My very dear Friends_,

I WISH you much joy. Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied upon you
both! It will, it will. Your match was certainly made in heaven. How do
I long to see you! I have been at my _ne plus ultra_ northward, and am
now more free and capable of settling my affairs southward. When that
is done, how chearfully, with a CHRIST in my heart instead of my arms,
could I sing, “LORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace!”
I hope you are not offended at my giving a power of attorney to Mr.
_H――――m_. The Redeemer knows it was not owing to a distrust of any of
you, but only in _case of my death_, that he might testify to the world
the integrity of your actions, and the veracity of your accounts. I am
persuaded he will not desire to interfere, but act and consult jointly,
as occasion offers; and you will go on in your old way. O that I was
assured of your stay at _Bethesda_! Of this I am satisfied, that you
will not distress me by leaving the place destitute of proper help.
And I assure you, if I thought we should have the _least demur_, I
would not come at all. My tottering tabernacle will not bear grief,
especially from those whom I so dearly love, and who have served the
institution so faithfully and disinterestedly for so many years. Verily
you shall in no wise lose your reward. What I have in my view for
_Bethesda_, may be better spoke of when me meet, than by letter. LORD
JESUS, hasten the wished-for time! At present, by my late excursions I
am brought low; but rest and care may brace me up again for some little
further service for our glorious _Emmanuel_. A most blessed influence
hath attended the word in various places, and many have been made
to cry out, “What shall we do to be saved?” O for such a cry at the
southward! Abba, Father, all things are possible with thee! To his
tender and never-failing mercy do I commit you, as being, my very dear
friends,

            Yours most affectionately in the blessed JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCIX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                            _Boston, April 25, 1764._

_My very dear Mr. K――――n_,

YOU are a friend indeed. The Friend of sinners, the King of saints,
will bless and reward you for all your works of faith and unfeigned
labours of love. Nay, he will bless both you and your children. GOD
grant, that roots and branches may all increase with all the increase
of GOD. I find I can do but little for him, and by a late return of my
disorder, was in danger of doing less. But, blessed be his name, I am
recovered, and yesterday got upon my throne again. Words cannot well
express the eagerness of the people to hear. I was meditating an escape
to the southward last week; but _Boston_ people sent a gospel hue and
cry after me, and really brought me back. LORD JESUS, let it be for
thy glory, and thy people’s good! Blessed be his name for giving you so
much prudence in the management of the Chapel and Tabernacle affairs,
and for countenancing the ministerial labours at both ends of the town.
_The burning bush_ may still be our coat of arms. By a ship that will
soon be going for _London_, I purpose to write to you and dear Mr.
_H――――y_ more particularly. I have very little time allowed to write
this, lest the vessel should be gone. Adieu. Tender love to all. Ten
thousand thanks, and most affectionate love await all mentioned in your
last, and all who are so kind as to enquire after, and pray for, dear
Mr. _K――――n_,

            Theirs, yours, &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCCX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                              _Boston, May 19, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR letter by the packet came safe, but I fear you must write again.
There can be no coming to _England_ till I have settled _Georgia_
affairs. Thither I cannot go till the fall: a few months will soon
glide away. Your _Isaac_ is well off. Of such is the kingdom of heaven.
People here beg earnestly for a six o’clock morning lecture. I hope to
get strength to gratify them. To be able to do what you say, will fully
satisfy! I would fain die preaching. Tender love to all. By the next
opportunity your worthy collegue shall hear from, my very dear friend,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXI.


                        _To C―――― H――――y, Esq._

                                              _Boston, June 1, 1764._

_Very dear Sir_,

I HOPE this will find you safe returned from your summer tour, and
laden with the fruit of GOD’s everlasting love. You see where this
leaves me. Friends have even constrained me to stay here, for fear
of running into the Summer’s heat. Hitherto I find the benefit of it.
Whatever it is owing to, through mercy, I am much better in health,
than I was this time twelvemonth, and can now preach thrice a week to
very large auditories without hurt. Every day I hear of some brought
under concern; and I trust, whenever I remove, a blessing will be left
behind. This is all of grace. To the glorious giver, purchaser, and
applier of it, be all the glory. All was well at _Georgia_ in _April_,
and I hope to be carried comfortably through the southern journey that
lies before me.

              CHRIST’s presence shall my pains beguile,
              And make each wilderness to smile.

In about a fortnight, GOD willing, I purpose to set forward. It will
be hard parting. But heaven will make amends for all. Blessed be GOD
that matters go on so well at _London_. If I get more bodily strength,
I shall think of another voyage with more comfort. But future things
belong to Him, who orders all things for the best. I would trust him
for the present day, and not be over solicitous for the morrow. LORD,
I believe, help thou my unbelief! Perhaps we may meet once more on this
side eternity. They tell me, that the Summers in these northern parts
have of late years been very cool. The event will shew. Let it suffice
that eternal truth hath assured us, that as our day is so our strength
shall be. I know I shall not want your prayers, or the prayers of your
dear relatives. Most cordial respects and ten thousand thanks await
them all; for indeed none are forgotten by, my very dear Sir,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in the blessed JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._


                                                            _June 7._

Parting here hath been heart breaking: I cannot stand it. I must
away for the southward. Mr. _T―――― C――――_ hath a packet that will be
delivered by a friend. O for heaven! There all will be together with
the LORD. _Hallelujah!_




                            LETTER MCCCXII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                           _New-York, June 25, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

HITHERTO the LORD hath helped me. The _New-England_ winter campaign
is over, and I am thus far on my way to _Georgia_. Mr. _Smith_,
my faithful host, writes thus: “Your departure hence never before
so deeply wounded us, and the most of this people; and they are
injudicious enough to propose sending a book full of names to call you
back. Your enemies are very few, and even they seem to be almost at
peace with you. I inclose five prints, which shew what is said of you
publicly; but as to private discourse, and secret intercessions, you
will willingly and modestly remain ignorant of the one, and, I doubt
not, feel sweetly the influences of the other.” I add, even so, LORD
JESUS, _Amen_! To crown the expedition, after preaching at _New-Haven_
college, the President came to me, as I was going off in the chaise,
and informed me that the students were so deeply impressed by the
sermon, that they were gone into the chapel, and earnestly entreated
me to give them one more quarter of an hour’s exhortation. Not unto me,
O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy free and unmerited grace be all the
glory! At present my health is better than usual, and as yet I have
felt no inconvenience from the summer’s heat. Praise the LORD, O my
soul! I write this in great haste, but with greater love to you and
yours, and to all. I beg leave to subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXIII.


                            _To Mr. W――――._

                                          _New-York, August 8, 1764._

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR last, I find, left you soaring aloft. I fancy you like being a
_Hebrew_ of the _Hebrews_. This, I hope, will meet you sitting low at
the feet of JESUS, and hearing his words. That is the safest place. He
continues good to me, a worthless worm, during this summer season. I
have preached twice lately in the fields, and we sat under the blessed
Redeemer’s shadow with great delight. Let every thing that hath breath
praise the LORD! In a short time I move southward. Perhaps in Spring
I may embark for _England_. But future things belong to him who orders
all things well. The _New-Jerusalem_ is the place I have in view.

              There sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is love and joy and peace.

Hearty love to your wife and all dear friends as they come in your way.
GOD bless you all! In Him, who is all in all, I am, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _New-York, August 19, 1764._

_My very dear Friends_,

I HAVE waited with eagerness for another letter. I want a particular
account of the necessaries you stand in need of. They might be procured
with advantage here or at _Philadelphia_. I hope you have received the
things. Something more will be sent by _Schemerron_ to the care of Mr.
_H――――m_. I hear another vessel is expected from _Georgia_ soon. Surely
I shall have a line then. I fear it will be the middle of _October_
before I can leave _Philadelphia_; but, GOD willing, you shall hear
more particularly soon. A never-failing JESUS continues to smile upon
my feeble labours, and hath hitherto carried me comfortably through the
summer’s heat. Help, O help me to praise him. Pray for us. Tender love
to all. Hoping to join with you quickly on earth, and in full assurance
of joining with you eternally in heaven, in very great haste, but
greater love, I subscribe myself, my very dear friends,

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

STILL am I kept as it were a prisoner in these parts, by the heat of
the weather. All dissuade me from proceeding southward till the latter
end of _September_. My late excursions upon _Long-Island_, I trust have
been blessed. It would surprize you to see above a hundred carriages
at every sermon in this new world. I am, through infinite mercy, still
kept up. Dear Mr. _H――――y_’s packet is not yet come to hand. I wrote
to him and my dear wife very lately by a friend in the packet, and I
have sent many letters for a letter-day to the care of Mr. _E――――s_
in _Bristol_. I thank dear Mr. _L――――d_ for his last by the packet. I
wrote to him just before his came to hand. Tender, tender love to your
whole self and to all.

            Ever theirs, ever yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                  _Philadelphia, September 21, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

YESTERDAY I had the pleasure of yours by the _New-York_ packet, and can
only in return send my repeated thanks for so many repeated favours.
After a most solemn and heart-breaking parting at _New-York_, I am come
thus far in my way to _Georgia_. There I hope to be about _Christmas_;
and in Spring, GOD willing, to embark for _England_. Hitherto the LORD
hath helped. However, let what will become of the substance, in the
mean while I send you my shadow. The painter, who gave it me, having
now the ague and fever, and living a hundred miles off, I must get you
to have the drapery finished, and then, if judged proper, let it be
put up in the Tabernacle parlour. One Captain _B――――_ brings it in the
_Philadelphia_ packet, and would most gladly have brought the original
over. If you see him, take a little notice of him. I have only preached
twice here, but the influence was deep indeed. Grace! grace! Before
my further removal hence, I hope for an opportunity of writing to dear
Mr. _H――――y_. Two such friends surely could not be picked out, for the
_London_ affairs. Tender, most tender love awaits him and all of you.
GOD bless you! GOD bless you! I am really better in health than I have
been these three years. Excuse my not writing to other dear friends;
the ship is going, my hands full of business, and I have little more
time allowed me than to return you ten thousand thanks, and subscribe
myself,

 Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._


                                                      _September 23._

Within a few days, but not before, I received the hymn books, and hope
to write to other friends in a few days by way of _Londonderry_. This
day has been a good day indeed. Grace! grace!




                           LETTER MCCCXVII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                   _Nassau-Hall, September 25, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

AT length I am broke loose from my summer’s retreat, and have preached
twice at _Philadelphia_. Many could say, “This was no other than the
house of GOD, the gate of heaven.” Yesterday I came here, to preach
at the commencement to-morrow. Surely it is one of the best regulated
institutions in the world. But most importunate calls come from every
quarter. So large is the range, that although I have been a twelvemonth
in _America_, I have scarce begun to begin. At present I can only go
strait forward, and preach in my way to _Georgia_. There I hope to be
about _Christmas_. GOD knows how I am to be disposed of afterwards:
whether to _England_, or to take another tour on the continent, is best
known to Him who orders all things well.

                To feel his power, to hear his voice,
                To taste his love, be all my choice.

Through infinite mercy my bodily health is somewhat improved. Perhaps
a few more months itinerating might improve it more. Father, thy will
be done! You and yours, I trust, prosper both in soul and body. Tender
love and hearty thanks await you, and all enquiring friends. If the
person in Mr. _D――――t_’s compting-house, would go over to _New-York_,
he might get a very handsome maintenance in teaching young gentlemen
and ladies to read well. O what new scenes open in this new world. In
every place the word hath run and been glorified. I could enlarge, but
am interrupted. You and yours will continue to pray for me. I retain my
old name. I am the chief of sinners, less than the least of all saints,
but for CHRIST’s sake, my very dear friends,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._


                                                         _October 3._

Since writing the above I have received your kind letter. Blessed be
GOD that you and yours are so well in the best sense. The books may be
committed to the care of Mr. _Mauduit_, agent for _New-England_. That
will give you least trouble. It is a good charity. LORD JESUS, accept
and bless it. _Amen_, and _Amen_!




                           LETTER MCCCXVIII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                    _Philadelphia, October 19, 1764._

_My very dear Friend_,

ACCEPT a few more lines before I set off for my southern tour. My last,
in which was a letter for my wife, left _New-York_ last _Sunday_. The
enclosed will inform you a little of my late motions. Pray tell dear Mr.
_H――――y_ that Dr. _S――――_, the Provost of the _Philadelphia_ college,
read prayers for me, and attended me backwards and forwards. Both the
present and late Governor, with the head gentlemen of the city, were
present, and cordial thanks were sent to me from all the Trustees,
for speaking for the children, and countenancing the institution. This
is all of GOD. To me nothing belongs but shame and confusion of face.
O for a truly guileless and _Israelitish_ heart! It will be found to
be the best policy at the great day. More good news await you in a
packet of letters directed to you, and committed to the care of Captain
_Sparks_, of the _Elizabeth_ and _Mary_. I believe he will deliver them
himself; if not, you may send for them. On the reading, I am apt to
believe you will think it is almost sinful not to take another tour.
LORD JESUS, do thou direct my goings in thy way! He will, he will. But
what is become of _T―――― C――――_? Mr. _R――――_ my worthy host wrote to
him many months ago, about being admitted a member of the society for
distributing books among the poor. Not a word of answer yet. Many more
want to be members. In a day or two, GOD willing, I set off for my
beloved _Bethesda_. O what blessings have we received in this place.
You will join in crying, _Hallelujah_, the LORD reigneth, and blessed
be the GOD of our salvation! To his never-failing mercy do I commend
you, as being, my very dear friend,

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXIX.


                        _To C―――― H――――y, Esq._

                  _New-Brunswick, North-Carolina, November 22, 1764._

_My very dear Sir_,

THROUGH the tender mercy of a never-failing Redeemer, I am thus far
advanced from _Philadelphia_ through _Virginia_, in my way southward.
At _Newburn_ last _Sunday_, good impressions were made. Several
gentlemen after sermon escorted me out of town. From that place to
this, I have met with what they call _New-lights_ almost every stage.
At _Lockwood’s-Folly_ (an unlikely place as _Rome_ itself) there is
to be a general rendezvous of them. This is grace indeed. I am to
call to-morrow on a wealthy planter that seems to lead the van. There
I shall enquire more particulars. I have the names of six or eight
of their preachers. This, with every other place, being open and
exceedingly desirous to hear the gospel, makes me almost determine
to come back early in the spring. Surely the _Londoners_, who are fed
to the full, will not envy the poor souls in these parts, who scarce
know the right hand from the left. As to spiritual things, a few gospel
crumbs in journeying, upon the whole, agrees with me. In less than
a week I hope to reach _Charles-Town_; from thence I purpose to
write again. Tender love to Mr. and Mrs. _B――――_, and to your whole
connections, and all dear dear friends who pray for, and enquire after,
my very dear Sir,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXX.


                            _To Mr. J――――._

                                    _Charles-Town, December 2, 1764._

_My dear Mr. J――――_,

THOUGH I have not had a line from you, since I wrote to you from on
board ship, yet I do not forget our old friendship, and therefore
was glad to hear by my wife’s letter, that you kept your place in the
despised tabernacle, where you and yours have so often met with GOD.
Ere long we shall meet in an upper world,

              Where sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is calm and joy and peace.

I hope you both enjoy large anticipations of this approaching,
uninterrupted, everlasting bliss. Ill and hell-deserving as I am,
a never-failing _Emmanuel_ continues kind to me,

                His presence doth my pains beguile,
                And makes the wilderness to smile.

In a little above a month we came by land from _Philadelphia_. This
morning I am to preach, and to-morrow, GOD willing, shall set forwards
for _Georgia_. Fain would I be a pilgrim to my last gasp. Continue to
pray for me, and remember me most kindly to all friends, as they come
in your way, and assure yourselves, my dear Mr. and Mrs. _J――――_, that
neither of you are forgotten by,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXXI.


                        _To C―――― H――――y, Esq._

                                       _Savannah, December 19, 1764._

_My very dear Sir_,

THIS leaves me sitting, where I would be glad dear Mr. _H――――y_,
_K――――n_, _B――――n_, &c. were for some moments. They would say, never
was a place more commodiously situated for a college. The enclosed will
shew you what providential steps have been taken towards it. All done
without the least hesitation. The colony is rising very fast, nothing
but plenty at _Bethesda_, and all arrears, I trust, will be paid off
before I leave it; so that in a short time I hope to be free from these
outward incumbrances. LORD JESUS, shew me whether I must go directly
to _England_, or make another northern excursion. I wish, if I do
come over, that Mr. _D――――n_ was engaged to stay always in town. Mr.
_D――――s_ seems to come, only because I am not in _London_. My spirits
will not bear the usual care. I hope your dear relations are better
than when you wrote last. Most cordial respects await them, and all
dear, very dear friends. I am obliged to Mr. _L――――d_ for his favour
dated _September 24_. It came to hand yesterday. I wish the voyage may
produce a volume of sermons; but I cannot write when I will. LORD JESUS,
do thou rule both heart and hand! Great favour is here given me, in the
sight of all. This is the LORD’s doing. In my next you may expect many
more particulars. Mr. _D――――n_ hath chartered a ship, and sent orders
for my having a passage _gratis_. Thus the great GOD continues his
unmerited goodness to, my very dear Sir,

                     Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                        _Bethesda, January 14, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

THROUGH tender mercy, I have been in this province above five weeks.
All things, in respect to _Bethesda_, went on successfully. GOD hath
given me great favour in the sight of the governor, council, and
assembly. A memorial was presented for an additional grant of lands,
consisting of two thousand acres. It was immediately complied with.
Both houses addressed the Governor in behalf of the intended college.
As warm an answer was given; and I am now putting all in repair,
and getting every thing ready for that purpose. Every heart seems to
leap for joy, at the prospect of its future utility to this and the
neighbouring colonies. The only question now is, whether I should
embark directly for _England_, or take one tour more to the northward?
He that holdeth the stars in his right hand, will direct in due time.
I am here in delightful winter quarters. Peace and plenty reign at
_Bethesda_. His Excellency dined with me yesterday, and expressed his
satisfaction in the warmest terms. Who knows how many youths may be
raised up for the service of the ever-loving and altogether lovely
JESUS? Thus far however we may set up our _Ebenezer_. Hitherto the bush
hath been burning, but not consumed.

              Blest is faith that waits GOD’s hour,
              Blest are saints that trust his power.

LORD, I believe, help thou my unbelief! You and yours will continue
to pray for me. Be pleased to accept this as a small token of
acknowledgment for all favours conferred upon, my very dear friend,

              Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXIII.


                           _To Mr. P――――e._

                                        _Bethesda, February 3, 1765._

_My dear Mr. P――――e_,

YOUR kind letter lies by me. Love unfeigned constrains me to answer it.
We have just been wishing that some of our _London_ friends were here.
We have love feasts every day. Nothing but peace and plenty reign in
_Bethesda_, this house of mercy. GOD be praised, for making the chapel
such a _Bethel_. I believe it will yet be a gate of heaven to many
souls. Whether we live or die, we shall see greater things. Remember,
my dear friend, to ask something worthy of a GOD to give. Be content
with nothing short of himself. His presence alone, can fill and satisfy
the renewed soul. Trials only empty the heart, and thereby make way
for further communications from above. Seed time and harvest, summer
and winter, will always succeed each other here. Do you not find it so,
dear Mr. and Mrs. _A――――r_, as well as your friend Mr. _P――――e_? Though
you do not write, I will venture to answer for you――Yes.――Well, then
let us go on, till we enter into our eternal summer, our uninterrupted
harvest. Haste we, haste we; the LORD is at hand! Pray that my tardy
pace may be quickened; get all enquiring friends to join with you; and
believe me to be, my dear Mr. _P――――e_,

                 Yours, &c. in our sympathizing LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXIV.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                       _Bethesda, February 13, 1765._

_My very dear Sir_,

A FEW days more, and then farewel _Bethesda_, perhaps for ever. Affairs,
as to me, I trust are now brought near a close. The within audit I sent
to the G――――r. Next day came Lord _J. A. G――――n_, to pay his Excellency
a visit. Yesterday morning, they with several other gentlemen favoured
me with their company to breakfast. But how was my Lord surprized and
delighted! After expressing himself in the strongest terms, he took me
aside, and informed me, “that the G――――r had shewn him the accompts,
by which he found what a great benefactor I had been: that the intended
college would be of the utmost utility to this and the neighbouring
provinces; that the plan was beautiful, rational, and practicable;
and that he was persuaded his M――――y would highly approve of, and also
favour it, with some peculiar marks of his royal bounty.” At their
desire I went to town, and dined with him and the G――――r at _Savannah_.
On _Tuesday_ next, GOD willing, I move towards _Charles-Town_, leaving
all arrears paid off, and some cash in hand, besides the last year’s
whole crop of rice, some lumber, the house repaired, painted, furnished
with plenty of cloathing, and provision till next crop comes in, and
perhaps some for sale. Messrs. _D――――n_, _S――――k_, and their wives,
stay till my successors come to supply their places. Only a few boys
will be left, and two of them are intended for the foundation. So that
this year they will be getting rather than expending. Near ten, boys
and girls, have been put out, and the small-pox hath gone through the
house, with the loss of about six negroes and four orphans. Before
which, I think not above four children have been taken off these
twenty-four years. As an acknowledgment of Mr. and Mrs. _D――――n_’s
faithfulness and care, I have made them a present of a bill of exchange
drawn upon you. It is for JESUS, who shed his dear and precious blood
for ill and hell-deserving me. And now it may be, I may see _England_
this summer. But still I cry, who shall roll away the stone? JESUS will
do it for me. And now farewel, my beloved _Bethesda_; surely the most
delightfully situated place in all the southern parts of _America_. I
do not forget your dear relations. What a blessed winter have I had!
Peace, and love, and harmony, and plenty, reign here. Mr. _W――――t_ hath
done much in a little time. All are surprized at it. But he hath worked
night and day, and not stirred a mile for many weeks. Help, help, my
dear _English_ friends, to pray me over, as being, for CHRIST’s sake,
my very dear Sir,

                      Ever yours, theirs, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXXV.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                       _Savannah, February 18, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

YESTERDAY we had a most cutting parting at _Bethesda_; but blessed be
GOD, for giving me to part from it in such comfortable circumstances!
All arrears are paid off, cash, stock, and plenty of all kinds of
provision before-hand, and under GOD, no danger, at least for this
year, of going back; so that one great load is taken off. What shall I
render unto the LORD of all Lords for this and all other his mercies?

                Praise GOD, my soul, even unto death,
                And raise a song with every breath.

And now my thoughts turn toward _England_. As a proof of it, I have
sent a box in the _Friendship_, Captain _Ball_, directed to you.
The things in the box, for the most part, do belong to Mr. _W――――t_,
and all of them, if I die in my way to _England_. That will be a
blessed voyage indeed! Brethren, pray for us, pray for us; and assure
yourselves of being never forgotten by, my dear old friend,

               Yours, theirs, &c. in everlasting bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXVI.


                       _To Mr. and Mrs. D――――n._

                                       _Charles-Town, March 5, 1765._

_My very dear dear Friends_,

OFTEN have we thought, and talked of, and if it was lawful, wished
ourselves at _Bethesda_ again. No place like that for peace, and plenty
of every kind. May this find you all enjoying GOD, and each others
company, in a manner the world knows not of! It leaves me in my poor
way, aiming to do a little for Him, who hath done and suffered so much
for ill and hell-deserving me. People of all ranks fly to the gospel
like doves to the windows. The word begins to fall with great weight,
and all are importunate for my longer stay. But next week I expect
to move. Captain _M――――r_, though waited for near two months, is not
yet arrived; Mr. _S――――n_’s Lady comes with him, when you may expect
a more particular letter. He sets off for _Georgia_ immediately upon
his Lady’s arrival. The negroes shirts, &c. are in hand. O that those
_Ethiopians_ may be made to stretch out their hearts unto GOD! I feel
a great compassion for them. Letters from the northward, give sweet
accounts of the spreading of the work of GOD; but I must not enlarge.
So many various calls surround me, that I have scarce leisure to
dispatch my private business. GOD bless you! GOD bless you all in
soul and body, in time and eternity! The parting here hath been
most affecting and awful. Several presume to prophesy, that I shall
certainly and speedily see _South Carolina_, and my beloved, dearly
beloved _Bethesda_ again. I say heartily, Amen! What say you? I shall
not wait for an answer. If the LORD JESUS say amen too, it will do. And
now for the present, adieu. GOD bless you, and fill you all with all
his fulness! Pray hard for us; pray, if possible, that the glorious
_Emmanuel_ would give me to see these parts once more. A blessed work,
I trust, is begun. Grace, grace! Perhaps this is not a parting letter.
You may hear from me more minutely by the Chief Justice; but who knows
what a day may bring forth! _A―――― H――――_’s wife died suddenly, a few
days before my return hither. Others taken, and I still left. LORD
JESUS, quicken my tardy pace! On _Friday_ next, GOD willing, I shall
read prayers and preach in _Ashby-Ferry_ church. Mr. _Z――――y_ hath
preached well here. Dear, very dear friends, continue to pray for me.
Indeed I pray for you night and day; and, GOD willing, this shall be
the constant employ of, my very dear, very dear friends,

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXVII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                      _Charles-Town, March 15, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

HITHERTO the LORD hath helped: I have had a most pleasant winter. The
inclosed will shew you in what a situation I left _Bethesda_. To put
the finishing stroke to that affair, I fear I must embark for _England_.
Well may I say _I fear_; for indeed words cannot well express what
a scene of action I leave behind. Alas! my _American_ work seems as
yet scarce begun. My health is better, and every day the word of GOD
runs and is glorified more and more. In two days, my wilderness range
commences afresh. In about six weeks I hope to see _Philadelphia_.
From thence, they say, I am to set sail for my native country. But
heaven! a blessed, long wished-for heaven, is my home. Surely, death
will say by and by, “Come up hither.” This, I trust, will find you
and yours mounting aloft. GOD bless you, and all your connections!
Indeed and indeed I owe you much, very much love. As a pepper-corn of
acknowledgment, be pleased to accept these few loving lines from, my
very dear friend,

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCXXVIII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                             _Wilmington, Cape-Fear, March 29, 1765._

_My very dear Mr. K――――_,

THUS far the LORD hath brought me in my way to _Philadelphia_, from
whence, according to the present scheme, I purpose to embark for
_England_. But I sometimes doubt, whether it is right or not. However,
this is my comfort, that I serve a master who will not suffer the blind,
that desire to know and do his will, to go out of their way. Hitherto
he hath made the wilderness to smile! We had a most cutting parting
from _Charles-Town_. I preached thrice in my way to this place. At
the desire of the Mayor and other gentlemen, I shall stay till next
_Sunday_, and then purpose, GOD willing, to go on my way. Indeed and
indeed, this pilgrimage kind of life, is the very joy of my heart.
Cieled houses and crouded tables I leave to others. A morsel of bread,
and a little bit of cold meat, in a wood, is a most luxurious repast.
JESUS’s presence is all in all, whether in the city or the wilderness.
I hope that you and my other dear metropolitan friends, in the midst of
all your noise, are always hearing that small still voice that whispers,
“Love.” I think much of the late trial of my never to be forgotten
friends at _Cannonbury-house_. Remember, according to promise, you will
be kind enough to act as trustee, and all things are to continue just
as they are, if it should please GOD to bring me to _London_. Now I am
free, GOD keep me so for CHRIST’s sake. Tender love to all. I send them
most cordial salutations, and intreat the continuance of their and your
prayers, in behalf of, my very dear Mr. _K――――_,

              Theirs and yours most affectionately in our
                       never-failing _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXIX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                _Newcastle, 30 miles from Philadelphia, May 4, 1765._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

I AM just come here, in my way to embark from _Philadelphia_. But how
shall I do it? Every where the door opens wider and wider. All along,
from _Charles-Town_ to this place, the cry is, “for CHRIST’s sake
stay and preach to us.” O for a thousand lives to spend for JESUS!
He is good, he is good! His mercy endureth for ever. Help, help,
my dear _English_ friends, to bless and praise Him. The letters by
Captain _Ball_, I hear are sent from _Charles-Town_, in my trunk, to
_Philadelphia_. I expect to receive them this evening. Thanks be to GOD,
all outward things are settled on this side the water. The auditing the
accounts, and laying a foundation for a college, hath silenced enemies
and comforted friends. The finishing this affair confirms my call to
_England_ at this time. But I have no manner of prospect of being able
to serve the tabernacle and chapel. I cannot preach once now, without
being quite exhausted. How then shall I bear the cares of both those
places? But I must beg you and dear Mr. _H――――y_ to continue trustees
when I am present, as well as in my absence. I wish that a ship was
ready now, perhaps I may yet sail from _New-York_. I am praying night
and day for direction. The word runs here, and is glorified. But the
weather, for two days, hath been so hot, that I could scarce move.
To-day it is much cooler. I dread the shaking of the ship. But if it
shakes this tottering frame to pieces, it will be a trading voyage
indeed. As Mr. _Blake_ is not mentioned in your last, I hope he is
recovered. Death will do this for us all. Blessed be GOD, for enabling
young Mr. _Beckman_ to face it so triumphantly! This must be a great
cordial to the afflicted parents. That they, your dear relations,
and all my tried friends, may be comforted yet more and more, is the
earnest prayer of, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, theirs, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXXX.


                           _To Mr. D――――n._

                                            _New-York, June 6, 1765._

_My very dear Friends_,

ACCEPT a few loving parting lines. Next _Sunday_, GOD willing, we sail
in the _Earl of Halifax_ packet. No ship offered at _Philadelphia_.
I am almost too weary to write. JESUS made the wilderness to smile!
Grace! grace! I have received letters from _England_, dated _April 13_,
in answer to those sent from _Georgia_. All say, you must come, or
_Bethesda_ affairs cannot be finished. Expect the first intelligence
after my arrival. In the mean while, cease not to remember us at the
throne of that JESUS; in whose great name, I desire to subscribe myself,
very dear dear friends,

                     Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXI.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                           _Plymouth, July 12, 1765._

_My dear dear Mr. K――――n_,

PERHAPS I am arrived a little before the expected time. We have had but
a twenty-eight days passage, in the _Hallifax_ packet, from _New-York_,
which got into _Falmouth_ last _Monday_. I left the vessel near the
_Lizard_, and by the blunder of a drunken fellow, missed the Post on
_Monday_ evening. The transition hath been so sudden, that I can scarce
believe that I am in _England_. I hope, ere long, to have a more sudden
transition into a better country. Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! I
want a gown and cassock. _Child_, in _Chancery-Lane_, used to make
for me, and perhaps knows my measure. Amazing, that I have not been
measured for a coffin long ago! LORD JESUS, thy will be done! I am very
low in body, and as yet undetermined what to do. Perhaps, on the whole,
it may be best to come on leisurely, to see if my spirits can be a
little recruited. You may write a few lines at a venture to _Bristol_.
dear Mr. _H――――y_ shall hear more particularly the next Post, whatever
rout I take. Had I bodily strength, you would find me coming upon you
unawares; but that fails me much. I must have a little rest, or I shall
be able to do nothing at all. Let no one stir to meet me, it being
uncertain what rout I shall take. The LORD JESUS be with all your
spirits! Ten thousand thousand thanks await you and your dear collegue,
and all your dear friends, for all assistance given to, my dear dear
friends,

                     Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                            _Bristol, July 18, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

JUST now, with great joy, I received your welcome letter, I fear the
post will be gone, ere this can be put in. Blessed be GOD, I am a
little better. I have a fine commodious house, and am kept from much
company. You will certainly know my rout. Indeed and indeed, I long to
see my dear Mr. _K――――n_, and my dear Mr. _H――――y_. Stand, my friends,
and insist upon my not being brought out into action too soon. The poor
old shattered bark hath not been in dock one week, for a long while. I
scarce know what I write. Tender love to all.

                     Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCXXXIII.


                           _To Mr. E――――s._

                                            _London, August 3, 1765._

_Dear Mr. E――――s_,

I AM very weak in body, but gratitude constrains me to send you a few
lines of love unfeigned, for your labours of love during my absence
abroad. I rejoice to hear they were blessed. Our friends tell me, that
the sound of your Master’s feet was certainly heard behind you. To Him,
and Him alone, be all the glory! Is not this encouragement, my dear
brother, to go on, and to be instant in season and out of season? If
GOD will work, who shall hinder?

              Give us thy strength, O GOD of power,
              Then let winds blow and thunders roar:
              Thy faithful witnesses we’ll be;
              ’Tis fix’d! we can do all through thee.

Thanks be to GOD, we do not go a warfare on our own charges; the
Captain of our salvation will conquer for and in us. Let us but
acknowledge him in all our ways, and He hath given us his royal word,
that “He will direct and prosper all our paths.”

                  Fix on his work our stedfast eye,
                  So shall our work be done.――――

Our enemies shall be at peace with us, and the very ravens, birds of
prey, shall be obliged to come and feed us. O for an increase of faith!
I hope you have refreshing times from the presence of the LORD, among
your own flock. May grace, mercy, and peace, be multiplied amongst
you! If the common interest of the Redeemer be promoted, I rejoice, yea
and will rejoice. My earnest prayer is, that you, and all that labour
in our LORD’s vineyard, may more and more be taught to give every one
their portion of meat in due season; and may your rod blossom more and
more! O to end life well. Methinks I have now but one more river to
pass over, _Jordan_. And we know of one that can carry us over, without
being ankle deep. How are Messrs. _G――――th, A――――ge_, &c. &c. _S――――k_
and his wife send cordial salutations. I left them labouring on their
_Bethesda_ plan, till the intended college is established. Yet a little
while, and all true labourers shall enter into the joy of their LORD.
Amen! _Hallelujah!_ Cease not to pray for, dear Mr. _E――――s_,

                   Yours, &c. in the blessed JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXIV.


                           _To Mr. D――――n._

                                         _London, September 6, 1765_.

_My very dear Friends_,

I AM sorry that matters have been so ordered, as to confine you so
long at _Bethesda_. But you have learned to believe, that the Redeemer
orders all things well. Soon after my arrival, Lord _D――――h_ was put at
the head of the board of trade. This will soon bring _Bethesda_ affairs
to a speedy issue. You will then be released. But indeed and indeed,
in my judgment you had best keep where you are. You will soon repent
coming over. Mrs. _R――――l_, whose husband is lame, is utterly against
your coming. But you must follow your own judgment. Though people
flock more and more, and my health is better, yet I make no secret of
it, that my heart is abroad. Mrs. _R――――l_ tells me strange things of
_B――――y_, and disagreeable things of _P――――y_. O my GOD! shall I have
no prize tickets amongst those I would willingly serve! Well,――the
faithful nurse shall be paid, whether the child lives or dies. You
therefore shall verily have your reward. Excuse enlarging. Captain
_Gunn_ goes to-day. Mr. _Wright_ sends cordial respects. My wife is
gone for a little while into the country. GOD bless you! GOD bless you!
More opportunities of sending will soon offer to, my very dear friends,

               Ever yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXV.


                        _To Mr. A―――― K――――n._

                                        _London, September 20, 1765_.

_My dear Timothy_,

PRAY when are we to have the honour of a visit from you? I believe more
than three weeks are elapsed since you came to _Bristol_. Mr. _Adams_
is to be your collegue here. I purpose for both of you to preach at
the chapel, as well as at the tabernacle. Write an immediate answer,
fixing your time of coming; and you must not think of returning soon.
Mr. _Middleton_ sends me word, that he is blessed at _Plymouth_, and
especially at dock, and that _Kingsbridge_ christians are lively. I
hope it is so at _Bristol_. Blessed be GOD, it is pretty much so in
_London_. LORD JESUS, quicken my tardy pace! Through his never-failing
mercy, I have been better in health for a week past, than I have been
for these four years. O for a thankful and an humble heart! My wife
also returned well, last night, from _Bury_. She indulges this morning,
being weary. But I take it for granted, that you and I rise at five.
Mr. _Adams_’s room will be large for you to breathe in. I shall never
breathe as I would, till I breathe in yonder heaven.

              There sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is calm and joy and peace.

Adieu. Cordial love awaits all where you are, all at tabernacle house,
and all that are so kind as to pray for, and enquire after, my very
dear _Timothy_,

              Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXVI.


                                        _London, September 28, 1765._

_My very dear Timothy_,

THOSE that are _Timothies_ indeed, shall be honoured of Him, whom they
desire to honour, with a disinterested spirit. I am glad you find old
_Jacob_’s prophecy to be fulfilling. “To _Shiloh_ shall the gathering
of the people be.” Nothing is wanting at _Bristol_, _London_, and
elsewhere, but labourers full of the first old methodistical spirit.
But where to get them is the question. Those that are thus minded,
are almost worn out. I would gladly fly to _Bristol_ if I could; but
I see that it is best to be here for some time. And indeed, things
have always been at such a low ebb, when I have been at _Bristol_, and
matters carried on with so little spirit, that I have generally come
mourning away. If a few, such as Mr. _C――――t_, would exert themselves
steadily, and perseveringly, and proper preachers were sent, something
might be done to purpose. But as neither of these things is likely to
happen, my expectations are not very much raised. However, the residue
of the spirit is in the Redeemer’s hands. Our eyes wait upon Him. From
Him, and Him alone, all kinds of salvation do come. Fain would I have
you up at _London_ for some time, at this season. Mr. _D――――r_ expects
to see you in a clerical habit about _Christmas_. He asked me, if I
would get him a scarf? I answered, that you must have one first. You
may guess how he smiled. However, I really intend you shall preach in
the chapel. I want you also to read the letters, and give me leave to
comment upon them, as my breath will allow. You may return by way of
_Bristol_, or if _Sarah_ is worse, go from hence. I thank you heartily
for making the collections. Never was a cause kept up at such a small
expence; “not by might, or by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD.”
This be our invariable rule. GOD bless and prosper you more and more.
If I have not tired you, I have almost tired, my very dear _Timothy_,

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Since writing the above, I find providence calls me to _Bath_,
to open good Lady _Huntingdon_’s chapel. GOD willing, I purpose to
set out next _Tuesday_. You must set out for _London_ the same day;
otherwise, it may be, _Bristol_ people will not see me. Adieu. Your
preaching orders, as to time and place, you will receive at your
arrival. That you may do Satan’s kingdom much hurt, is the hearty
prayer of, my very dear man,

                  Ever yours, &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCXXXVII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                             _Bath, October 7, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

WHAT a providence (as matters have fallen out) that your _Bath_ journey
was prevented! Could you have come, and been present at the opening of
the chapel, you would have been much pleased. The chapel is extremely
plain, and yet equally grand. A most beautiful original! All was
conducted with great solemnity. Though a very wet day, the place
was very full, and assuredly the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls
consecrated and made it holy ground by his presence. I preached in the
morning, Mr. _Townsend_ in the evening. Expect more particulars when we
meet. My moving depends on Mr. _M――――n_’s punctuality. I am to preach
to-morrow night, and have hopes of setting off on _Wednesday_ morning.
GOD give us all grace to work whilst it is day! The time of sickness
and lowness comes, when no man can work. Dear Miss _H――――y_ is happily
fled from all. Happy, happy she. GOD comfort all surviving relatives.
They, as well as you and yours, are never forgotten by, my very dear
Sir,

               Yours, &c. &c. in Him who is all in all,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCXXXVIII.


                           _To Mr. D――――n._

                                          _London, October 26, 1765._

_My very dear Friend_,

ACCEPT a few hasty but loving lines. Your letters came safe. I thank
GOD for their contents. In return I can inform you, that _Bethesda_
matters are likely to come to a speedy and happy issue. We talk of
my coming over again. It is not impossible, if my health admits. At
present, blessed be GOD, I am better than last year. The word runs and
is glorified in _London_. _Bet D――――y_ must not come here. You have not
been so explicit as was Mrs. _R――――l_ about her. Instead of her, pray
send over a barrel of rice or two, directed to Mr. _T―――― C――――a_, in
_Winchester-street_, near _Moorfields_. Pray inform Mr. _H――――m_, that
I hope to send him some pleasing particulars by the next ship. I have
much to say, but have scarcely a moment left to send you my hearty
thanks and blessing, and subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

              Ever yours, &c. in the glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXXXIX.


                       _To ――――, at Sheerness._

                                          _London, January 18, 1766._

_Dearly Beloved_,

NOT want of love, but of leisure and health, hath occasioned you the
trouble of writing a second letter. And now I am sorry to acquaint you,
that it is not in my power to comply with your request. For want of
more assistance, I am confined in town with the care of two important
posts, when I am only fit to be put into some garrison among the
invalids, to stand by an old gun or two. However, my former ambition
still remains, and through the help of your prayers, who knows but this
feeble arm may yet be strengthened to annoy the enemy? If others are
blessed to do any execution, GOD forbid that I should hinder, though
in all things they follow not with us. Let the LORD send by whom he
will send. So that CHRIST is preached, and true evangelical holiness
promoted, I rejoice, yea and will rejoice. GOD keep us all from
flagging in the latter stages of our road! LORD JESUS, quicken my
tardy pace! How little, my LORD and my GOD, have I done for thee, who
hast done and suffered so much for ill and hell-deserving me! Brethren,
pray for us. Ere long we shall meet

              Where sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is calm and joy and peace.

He is faithful who hath promised, who also will do it. _Amen!
Hallelujah!_ To his never-failing mercy do I commend you, as being,
for his great name’s sake, dearly beloved,

             Your affectionate friend and willing servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXL.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                           _Bristol, March 17, 1766._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

THE uncertainty of my motions hath made me slow in writing, and a
desire to be a while free from _London_ cares, hath made me indifferent
about frequent hearing from thence. In a day or two, I hope matters
will be determined. If Mr. _S――――d_ comes, I have a mind to stay
a little longer; and if dear Mr. _Howell D――――_ will continue to
officiate, I have a mind to visit _Wales_ for him. Last _Friday_
evening, and twice yesterday, I preached at _Bath_, to very thronged
and brilliant auditories. I am told it was a very high day. The glory
of the LORD filled the house. To-morrow, GOD willing, I return thither
again. Mr. _T――――d_ is too ill to officiate. If any urgent business
requires, be pleased to direct either to this place or _Bath_. Pray
shew my wife this. I hope no news is good news. I trust that the
holy Spirit is moving in Mr. ――――’s family, both on the heads and the
servants of it. Many do think old times are coming round again. Pray
tell Mr. _W――――r_, that I think the letters he hath sent need not go
to _Scotland_ as yet. I sent a packet thither last week. This I write
in the midst of company. Lady _H――――n_ is mounting on her high places.
I wished my two steady friends at _Bath_ yesterday. Mr. _S――――t_ hath
met with a great blessing. Pray, pray for us. All send due respects.
_Tuesday_ or _Wednesday_ next I hope to write again to my wife. Cordial
respects and love attend her, your whole self, dear Mr. _H――――y_ and
sisters, Mr. _Howell D――――_, and all that are so kind to enquire after
and pray for, my dear Sir,

          Theirs, yours, &c. &c. in our never-failing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCXLI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                            _London, April 25, 1766._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

NOT want of love, but of leisure and better health, hath prevented
your hearing from me more frequently. I find I cannot do as I have
done. But, through infinite, free, and sovereign mercy, I am enabled
to ascend my gospel throne three or four times a week, and a glorious
influence attends the word. People have indeed a hearing ear, but we
want more preachers. I know the continual cry of your heart is, “LORD,
let thy kingdom come.” The prospect of a large and effectual door
opening among the heathen, blessed be GOD, is very promising. Mr.
_Occum_, the _Indian_ preacher, is a settled humble christian. The
good and great, with a multitude of a lower degree, heard him preach
last week at _Tottenham-Court_ chapel, and felt much of the power and
presence of our common LORD. Mr. _R――――n_ hath preached, and collected
a hundred pounds, and I believe seven or eight hundred pounds more
are subscribed. The truly noble Lord _D――――h_ espouses the cause most
heartily, and his Majesty is become a contributor. The King of kings
and LORD of all lords will bless them for it. O what an honour to be
permitted to do or suffer any thing for JESUS of _Nazareth_! Indeed
and indeed, I want to begin to begin: for hitherto, alas! I have done
nothing.

                Whene’er you see a barren tree,
                Then, O my friend, pray think of me.

LORD JESUS, make me willing to be made willing that thou shouldst dig
and dung around me, that I may at length bring forth some fruit unto
thee. However it may be with unprofitable, ill, and hell-deserving me,
I trust your whole self and all my other dear _G――――_ friends are so
grown as to become tall cedars in the spiritual _Lebanon_. I pray for,
though I cannot write to them. Hearty, special love attend my dear host,
and his yoke-fellow. If possible they shall hear from me soon. I hope
all is well at _Cambuslang_. Blessed be GOD, all will be well in heaven.
Yet a little while and we shall enter into perfect rest. He that cometh
will come, and will not tarry.

              We soon shall hear th’ archangel’s voice;
              The trump of GOD shall sound, Rejoice!

I will not interrupt you. You want to say, _Amen! Hallelujah!_ I only
add, when upon the mount, put in a word for an old friend, who retains
his old name, the chief of sinners, less than the least of all saints,
but for JESUS CHRIST’s sake, reverend and very dear Sir,

                         Your willing servant,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXLII.


                        _To W―――― P――――, Esq._

                                     _Tottenham-Court, May 15, 1766._

THOUGH at present in almost a breathless state, by preaching for the
best of Masters last night, yet a weak worm hopes to be strengthened to
give the holy sacrament at seven next _Sunday_ morning, and, if able,
to preach afterwards at ten. If good Mr. _R――――_ and Lady will come
at near seven to the chapel house, they shall be conducted to a proper
place. I wish them a Pentecost, not only on _Whitsunday_, but every
day, every hour, and every moment of their lives. Our privilege, as
christians, is not to be afraid of, but looking towards, and waiting
for the coming of the Son of GOD. He expects that our lamps should be
trimmed, our loins girded, and our lamps burning. There is oil enough
in him, our glorious _Aaron_, to keep them so. It runs to the very
skirts of his garments, even to the least member of his mystical body,
and therefore to the heart and soul of, dear happy pair,

WHAT a mercy, that GOD’s elect, knit by the blessed Spirit, (that
common centre of unity) in one communion and fellowship, can, though
absent, be present with each other on earth! What an infinitely greater
mercy, that they are assured they shall meet never to part again in
heaven! This may reconcile them to all interruptions of mutual concern
here below. My cloud seems to point towards _Bristol_ and _Bath_; yours
towards _Brighthelmstone_. All travelling the same road, all engaged
in the same errand. How glad will the truly noble Countess be of the
intended visit! How will the hearts both of the visited and visitors be
made to burn within them! She meets with that, which all fond fathers
and apostolic mothers in _Israel_ must meet with; I mean, rebuffs from
her spiritual children. That _monstrous doctrine of sinless perfection_,
for a while turns some of its deluded votaries into temporary monsters.
Happy they who strive to be holy as he who hath called them is holy,
and yet are continually going out of themselves, and relying only on
the glorious, compleat, imputed righteousness of JESUS CHRIST. This
hath a certain happy pair learned, and received CHRIST. Thus may they
be helped continually to walk in him! They will, they will. The meek,
the humble, hungering and thirsty soul will he guide in his ways. But
what am I doing? writing a parting letter? The LORD bless you and keep
you; the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto
you; the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace. So
wishes, so prays, dear honoured and happy pair,

             Yours, &c. &c. &c. in an unchangeable JESUS,

LAST night we lay at the _Devizes_. This morning we breakfasted at
_Shaw-House_, near _Melksom_, with Mr. _C――――n_. In my way hither, I
called upon Mrs. _E――――n_. Her account of Miss _Winter_’s decease, was
by no means unpleasant. She was taken suddenly, and though speechless,
continued to smile upon all in a very remarkable manner, till the last
gasp, which was with much struggle. Mr. _P――――s_ is left executor of
the will. Being weary with riding, I think to stay here till after
_Sunday_ morning’s sermon, and then shall set off for _Bristol_. The
horse turns out exceeding well in every respect. I hope you, my dear
Sir, got safe to _London_. That you and all your dear relations, and
all dear friends in town, may, in the glorious _Emmanuel_’s due time,
arrive triumphant in heaven, earnestly prays, my very dear Sir,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

_My dear Friend_,

HERE I am, in a large vacant country house, where Mrs. _Wollaston_ was
last Summer. She hath got the start of me; but my turn must come by and
by. As my feverish heat continues, and the weather is too wet to travel,
I have complied with the advice of friends, and have commenced an
hot-well water drinker twice a day. However, twice this week, at six
in the morning, I have been enabled to call thirsty souls to come and
drink of the water of life freely. To-morrow evening, GOD willing, the
call is to be repeated, and again on _Sunday_. By that time, perhaps,
the cloud may point to some particular corner. Dear Mr. _H――――y_ shall
know in due time. Good seasons at _Bath_. Good seasons here. Large
auditories. Grace! grace! I hope that my wife, and yours, and all dear
friends, are well. Cordial love awaits them and dear Mr. _E――――s_, and
all who are so kind as to enquire after, and pray for, my dear friend,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_Happy Heirs of the Grace of Life_,

BY your giving young Mr. _R―――― H――――_ hints about a proper direction,
I have inferred, that a line, though from one who is less than the
least of all, would not be altogether unacceptable. I am sure my poor
prayers are continually ascending to the throne of grace in your behalf.
I want to have you great, yea very great in the kingdom of heaven.
Have you not found, by your heart’s being warmed with the conversation
of gospel ministers, that your heaven is begun on earth? Dear Mr.
_F――――er_ is become a scandalous _Tottenham-Court_ preacher. I trust
he will come down into your parts, baptized with the Holy Ghost as with
fire. Dear Mr. _R――――n_ hath been much owned in good Lady _H――――n_’s
chapel. Ill and hell-deserving I, am to go thither next week. Dear Mr.
_M――――n_ is detained at _Aldwinckle_, by his children having the
small-pox in town. The shout of a king is yet heard in the _Methodist_
camp. The glorious cry, “What shall I do to be saved,” is frequently
sounding in our ears. Had we more reproach, and were we more scandalous,
more good would be done. Several promise well. Some say _shibboleth_
with a good grace, and very proper accent; others, as yet, can only
say _sibboleth_: but I have heard of one who can teach the tongue of
the stammerer to speak plain. Good Lady _H――――n_ is an excellent school
mistress in this way. The writer of the letter on the other side, seems
to be an apt scholar. The person referred to, keeps house where dear Mr.
_S――――t_ constantly expounds. He is in a consumption. What a mercy that
such a confessor should be sent to prison! I want all the followers of
the Lamb in general, and a certain gospel happy pair in particular, to
grow higher and richer every day towards GOD. Time is short; eternity
is endless; the Judge and judgment are at the door.

              We soon shall hear th’ archangel’s voice;
              The trump of GOD shall sound, Rejoice!
                                        Amen! Hallelujah!

But I must have done. A dear company of ministerial cast-outs are
coming to breakfast under my despised roof. It stinks too much for
worldlings. If you would be so good as to let dear Mr. _Hill_ see the
_Oxonian_ letter, it may be of service. Next _Tuesday_, GOD willing, I
shall read an account of his servant’s death. May the last end of every
christian master be like his! But I cannot die: cold bathing, and cool
weather, brace up my tottering tabernacle. I hope that both to whom
I am writing, enjoy thriving souls in healthy bodies. That they may
increase with all the increase of GOD, earnestly prays,

_My dear Friend_,

THROUGH mercy I slept at Mr. _C――――_’s, as proposed, but have been
low ever since my coming here. _Bath_ air, I believe, will never agree
with me long. However, if good is done, all will be well. They tell me,
that _Sunday_ and last night were seasons of power. Some we trust were
made willing. I hope you enjoy much of GOD in town. Surely _London_
is the _Jerusalem_ of _England_. Happy they who know the day of their
visitation! Mr. _Whitaker_ writes me word, that he is to be at _Exeter_
the 18th instant: but I have no heart to draw with, or act for him,
till the trust is settled in a proper manner. Besides, I see no
opening here: and Mr. _S――――t_ writes me word, that the door is shut at
_Oxford_. As I am so poorly, I question whether I shall go to _Bristol_
at all. GOD help us to look up, and look out, and our path will be made
plain before us. Remember me to all at Tabernacle, &c. &c. I hope to
write to Mr. _F――――r_ to-morrow or next day, and also to Mr. _H――――y_.
I am just now obliged to go out, and have only time to entreat the
continuance of your prayers in behalf of, my dear friend,

                 Yours, &c. in an unchangeable JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

ON _Tuesday_ evening I preached at _Bristol_ to a very crouded auditory,
though the weather was very foul. Last night I administered the
sacrament there also. We used near eight bottles of wine. I trust some
tasted of the new wine of the kingdom. This morning, upon my arrival
here, your kind letter gave me great comfort. I want just one week more
to settle _Bristol_ affairs; and have, therefore, written to dear Mr.
_J――――e_ to stay two or three weeks at _London_: Mr. _D――――s_, who they
say is expected here next week, may then officiate for that space of
time at _Bath_, and at Mr. _J――――e_’s leaving _London_, may go up to
town. _Satan_ hath had leave to give Captain _J――――s_ a fine parting
blow. Mr. _C――――_ may be dismissed immediately; and I beg that Captain
_J――――s_ would go through with the Tabernacle work, and stick to it
with his whole heart. I hear nothing as yet of the _Americans_. Letters
may be reserved till my return. I hope at farthest to be in _London_
by next _Tuesday_ se’nnight, and to preach at Tabernacle the following
evening. I was afraid my wife would get cold by her late excursions,
as at other times she is so confined. My hearty love awaits you all.
Be pleased to shew her this. I am afraid that in my next to her, she
will hear of the death of _J―――― S――――_. He is now ill of the present
dangerous fever. O for a heart broken with a sense of sin! Then
shall we look to Him whom we have pierced, and mourn. May this be our
habitual frame! GOD bless you all.

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Sir_,

SUCH a numerous brilliant assembly of the mighty and noble, I never
saw attend before at _Bath_. Every thing is so promising, that I was
constrained to give notice of preaching next _Sunday_. I hope the
Redeemer will give us a blessed sabbath. I trust already the arm of the
LORD hath been revealed. Congregations have been very large and very
solemn. O what _Bethels_ hath JESUS given to us! We were filled as with
new wine! O that GOD would make my way into every town in _England_!
Methinks I long to break up fresh ground, and to begin to begin to do
something for JESUS. I am just come here weary, but am going to speak a
few words. This prevents my enlarging; but I could not refrain writing
to one I so dearly love, and to whom I am so greatly obliged. GOD
bless you! GOD bless you and yours! Accept most unfeigned love and
acknowledgments, and still add to my innumerable obligations, by
praying for, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Sir_,

THE _Christmas_ holiday season hath prevented my sending an immediate
answer to your last kind letter. The order therein given shall be
readily complied with, and the love therein expressed, returned, by
praying for the writer’s whole self, and the honourable, christian, and
ministerial circle with which they are at present happily surrounded
with, _four Methodist parsons_. Honourable title! so long as attended
with the cross. When fashionable, (and blessed be GOD there is not much
danger of that) we will drop it. _Four Methodist parsons!_ enough (when
JESUS says, Loose them and let them go) to set a whole kingdom on fire
for GOD. I wish them prosperity in the name of the LORD. _I pre sequar
etsi non passibus æquis._ Fy upon me, fy upon me, fifty-two years old
last _Saturday_; and yet, O loving, ever-loving, altogether lovely
JESUS, how little, yea how very little have I done and suffered for
thee! Indeed and indeed, my dear and honoured friends, I am ashamed
of myself: I blush and am confounded. To-morrow, GOD willing, and
_Thursday_ also, with many hundreds more, I intend to take the
sacrament upon it, that I will begin to begin to be a christian. Though
I long to go to heaven to see my glorious Master, what a poor figure
shall I make among the saints, confessors, and martyrs, that surround
his throne, without some deeper signatures of his divine impress,
without more fears of christian honour. Our truly noble mother in
_Israel_, is come to _London_ full of them. _Crescit sub pondere virtus.
_ She is come out of her cell, with her face shining again. Happy they
who have the honour of her acquaintance! Highly honoured are those
ministers, who have the honour of preaching for and serving her. Good
and honest and dearly beloved Sir _C――――s_, and all your happy circle,
male and female, I am persuaded are of my mind. O this single eye,
this disinterested spirit, this freedom from worldly hopes and worldly
fears, this flaming zeal, this daring to be singularly good, this holy
laudable ambition to lead the van; O it is, what? an heaven upon earth!
O for a plerophory of faith! To be filled with the Holy Ghost. This
is the grand point. GOD be praised that you have it in view! All our
lukewarmness, all our timidity, all our backwardness to do good, to
spend and be spent for GOD, is all owing to our want of more of that
faith, which is the inward, heart-felt, self-evident demonstration of
things not seen. But whither am I going? Pardon me, good Sir: I keep
you from better company. Praying that all (if you live to be fifty-two)
may not be such dwarfs in the divine life as I am, I hasten to
subscribe myself, most honoured friends,

                     Yours, &c. &c. &c. in JESUS,

_My very dear Friends_,

THANK GOD that you have been so providentially detained on your
side the water. Indeed you would find it hard to live here. I would
fain have you see _Bethesda_ put on its college dress. That hour, I
humbly hope, is now not very far off. What if we should have one more
interview here below? Happy Mrs. _S――――k_, that is fled to her mansions
above. Blessed be GOD, that there are mansions prepared for us also!

                          O glorious King,
                          Us thither bring
                          To see thy face.

He will, he will, he will. He is faithful who hath promised; he also
will do it. May faith and patience have their perfect work! Adieu, for
the present. My feeble hands are full of work. The shout of the King
of kings is yet amongst us, and hath been all the last Winter. Grace!
grace! To this almighty, never-failing grace, I most humbly commit you;
and with repeated thanks for your steady, disinterested services, beg
leave to subscribe myself, my very dear friends,

              Ever yours, &c. &c. in JESUS of _Nazareth_,

_My dear Friend_,

STILL I serve a GOD whose mercy endureth for ever. Mr. _D――――n_
received us most gladly. As sweet a gospel excursion as at any time.
The _Cambridge_ interview, I trust, was of GOD. I met, within three
miles of _Norwich_, with another clergyman of the establishment, who
promises well. He heard me last night. It was a night of power: a large
congregation. It will be too large, I fear, to-morrow, though the place
will hold some thousands. I expect to preach twice in my way to town,
which I hope to reach by _Thursday_ evening. But I fear my Spring and
Summer inward fever is returning. If so, my large intended plan of
operations will be much contracted. But future things belong to Him who
orders all things well. Remember me before his throne. Salute dear Mr.
_H――――y_, _D――――s_, and _E――――s_ (if come to town) and all enquiring
friends, and accept the same for your whole self, from, my dear friend,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

MY new horse failed the first night; but, through mercy, we got here
yesterday about seven in the evening. I was regaled with the company
of some simple-hearted, first-rate old Methodists, of near thirty
years standing. GOD willing, I am to preach to-morrow morning, and
to have a general sacrament on _Friday_ evening. Perhaps I may move
after _Sunday_ towards _Wales_; but must be obliged, I fear, to take
post-horses. I care not, so that I can ride post to heaven. Hearty love
to all that are posting thither, hoping myself to arrive first. This
tabernacle often groans under the weight of my feeble labours. O when
shall I be uncloathed! When, O my GOD, shall I be cloathed upon! But I
am a coward, and want to be housed before the storm. It is nearer and
nearer. Happy they who have fled to CHRIST for refuge! I could enlarge,
but have only time to send you my most unfeigned thanks and most
cordial love, as being, my very dear Sir,

                   Yours, &c. in our glorious Head,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Gloucester, May 20, 1767._

_Dear Mrs. M――――h_,

AND is the right hand at last cut off? How long, how painful the
operation! How aukward, how uneasy ♦to be without it! But hush, nature:
it is the LORD’s doing. His own right arm shall bring salvation; his
presence shall alleviate the pain. Perhaps the loss of the hand, even
of such a right hand, may, through the powerful influences of the
blessed Spirit, give strength to their feet, and quicken them in their
motion heavenward. The right hand of the LORD can, and I trust will
bring this mighty thing to pass. Only say, “Abba, Father, be it unto
me even as thou wilt;” the answer will be, “This is my will, even thy
sanctification.” But,

                Wheels encircling wheels must run,
                Each in course to bring it on.

Want of time forbids enlarging. I hope your daughter will be now a wise
virgin indeed. We have had good seasons at _Rodborough_. I have been
out twice in the fields. Lady _H――――n_ hath been wonderfully delighted.
She and her company lay at _Rodborough_ house. Dear Mr. _A――――s_ is
going to be married to a good christian nurse. He is sickly in body,
but healthy in soul. That you may enjoy a thriving soul in a healthy
body, earnestly prays, dear Mrs. _M――――h_,

        Your sympathizing friend and servant for CHRIST’s sake,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friends_,

SURELY your many favours demand a speedy return of thanks. They are all
put down in his book, who is not so unrighteous as to forget any work
of faith, or labour that proceedeth of love. This is the principle from
which, I am persuaded, you act: and a blessed principle it is. It comes
from above, and leads to above. Had I more of this, and bodily strength
proportionable, how would I wing my way! How would I preach for my GOD!
How would I

                  Strive to sing as loud as they,
                  Who shine above in brighter day!

Blessed be GOD, we have reason to praise him whose mercy endureth for
ever. I have preached twice in the open air: thousands and thousands
attended. I am going to preach here this morning in my native city. On
_Sunday_ I hope to take to _Rodborough_ wood again. Good Lady _H――――n_,
&c. were wonderfully delighted. They honoured dear Mr. _A――――s_’s
house with their presence. He is but poorly, and wants a nurse. Perhaps
before next _Sunday_ he may be married to a simple-hearted, plain, good
creature, that hath waited upon him and the preachers near twenty years.
She hath no fortune, but is one who, I think, will take care of, and be
obedient to him for CHRIST’s sake. You may let _Betty W――――d_ see the
contents of this, upon condition that you with her cease not to pray
for, my very dear friends,

                Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

I AM just setting out in a post-chaise for _Haverford-west_; and have,
therefore, drawn upon you in favour of Mr. ――――, for twenty pounds.
This is expensive. But it is for one, who hath promised not to send us
a warfare on our own charges. We had a most blessed season yesterday.
Thousands and thousands, I trust, heard, saw, and felt. Mr. _Adams_
preached in the evening on, “The LORD is my portion, therefore will I
trust in him.” A good text for a new-married man. I have advised him to
preach next on these words, “The LORD’s portion is his people:” he is
now here. I expected a line. Be pleased to direct to _Haverford-west_.
I beseech you follow me with your prayers. O that the LORD may be my
strength. O that he may quicken my tardy pace, and make me all alive
for his glorious interest! I could enlarge, but must away. My tender
love awaits you and yours. The LORD JESUS bless you, and fill you with
all his fulness. Thus prays, my dear steady friend,

                       Yours in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCLVII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                      _Haverford-west, May 31, 1767._

_My dear dear Friend_,

YOUR spiritual mind medley was very agreeable. I could wish for a
second dose, but know not what direction to give about sending it. My
rout is not yet fixed. I am just come from my field throne. Thousands
and thousands attended by eight in the morning. Life and light seemed
to fly all around. On _Tuesday_, GOD willing, I am to preach at
_Woodstock_; on _Friday_, at _Pembroke_; here again next _Sunday_ by
eight, and then for _England_. I wish dear Mr. _H――――y_ present, to see
the people:――but,――and there are so many other _buts_ in the way, that
I would not press him. Mr. _D――――s_ is returned in safety. I hope Mr.
_B――――dge_ will not miss of his expected preferment. _Joab_’s hand is
in the _G――――h_ scheme. Rooms are not so lofty or large, prospects not
so pleasant, bedsteads not so easy, in these parts, as in some places
in or near _London_, but all good enough for young and old pilgrims
that have got good breath. Tender love to all. Let all join in prayer
for us. I have been pushing on dear sick Mr. _D――――s_, to go out and
preach six miles off. He is gone finely mounted, and I am persuaded
will return in high spirits. Who knows, who knows but preaching may be
our grand catholicon again? This is the good methodistical, thirty year
old medicine. That you may live to see it revived, and tried a thousand
and a thousand times over, is the hearty prayer of, my dear dear friend,

                        Ever yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                                      _Haverford-west, June 1, 1767._

_My very dear Friends_,

YOU will be so kind as to shew all manner of _Bethesda_ civilities to
the bearer, Mr. _Edward E――――n_. I trust, he hath been truly moved by
the Holy Ghost, to enter into the ministry. With him I hoped to have
sent the charter, or rather brought it; but the hour is not yet come.
You will be glad to hear, that I have strength to preach in the fields.
They are yet white ready unto harvest. Hoping to put forth the gospel
sickle again in my beloved _America_, and wishing you all to increase
with all the increase of GOD, with ten thousand thanks for all your
works of faith, and labours of unfeigned love, I hasten to subscribe
myself, my very dear friends,

              Ever yours, &c. &c. &c. in the best bonds,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCLIX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                         _Gloucester, June 10, 1767._

_My very dear Friend_,

BLESSED be GOD, I am got on this side the _Welsh_ mountains! Blessed be
GOD, I have been on the other side. What a scene last _Sunday_! What a
cry for more of the bread of life! But I was quite worn down. Blessed
be GOD, I am now better than could be expected. To-morrow evening, GOD
willing, my wife shall know what rout. I hope all are well. I expect
dear Mr. _H――――y_ is gone, therefore I do not write to him. How it
shall please the LORD to deal with me in my next remove, you shall hear.
I count it my privilege to let you know all good news, because I know
it puts gladness into your heart. It is food, it is physic, it is every
thing to a soul that lives near to JESUS. O when shall I begin to live
to Him, as I would! I want to be a flame of fire. I know, my very dear
Sir, you will pray for me. I can never forget you or yours. I am, my
very dear friend,

           Yours most affectionately in our glorious JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCLX.


                                             _London, July 21, 1767._

_My dear Sir_,

I HOPE, ere this comes to hand, you will have taken your second degree.
A good degree indeed: to be a preacher, a young preacher, a mobbed,
perhaps a stoned preacher――O what an honour! How many prayers will you
get when I read your letter at Tabernacle; and the prayers of so many
dear children of GOD will do you no hurt, I assure you. When we are
fighting with _Amalek_ below, it is good to have a _Joshua_ praying for
us above. JESUS is our _Joshua_, JESUS is our intercessor; he liveth,
he ever liveth to make intercession, especially for his young soldiers.
Yonder, yonder he sits: whilst praying he reaches out a crown: at
this distance you may see written in capital letters, _Vincenti dabo_.
All a gift, a free gift, though purchased by his precious blood. Tell
churchmen, tell meetingers, tell the wounded, tell all of this: tell
them when you are young; you may not live to be old: tell them whilst
you are an under graduate; you may be dead, buried, glorified, before
you take a college degree: tell those who would have you spare yourself,
that time is short, that eternity is endless, that the Judge is before
the door: but I can no more,――the thought overwhelms: but with what?
with joy, joy unspeakable and full of glory. Good night! I long to hear
particulars from ――――. If you send me word that young ―――― is there, I
will answer his letter that hath lain by me some time. My poor prayers
await you all. GOD bless you! GOD bless you!

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCLXI.


                                            _London, August 6, 1767._

_My dear Sir_,

IT is late; but I must answer your request. The inclosed made me pity,
smile, and rejoice: smile at the writer’s worn-out sarcasms, pity
his ignorance, and rejoice that you are thus called to be a martyr, a
living martyr for our common LORD. Fear not, only go forwards; you know
JESUS, and by preaching will know more. To him that hath shall be given.

            For this let men despise your name,
            You’ll shun no cross, you’ll fear no shame.
            All hail reproach!

If you write _with all deference_, let him know that JESUS hath
revealed himself not only _to_ you by his word, but _in_ you by his
spirit: that you look upon those whom he is pleased to term _deluded_
and _fanatics_, as the excellent ones upon the earth; and that you
choose rather to suffer reproach with them, than to enjoy all the
pleasures of sense, and all the preferments in the world. But why do I
dictate? I trust you to the teachings of that JESUS who hath said, “It
shall be given you in that hour what you shall say.” Where doth this
―――― live? What is the ―――― he mentions? GOD grant it may be a nursery
for what he calls _fanatics_ so long as one stone is left upon another.
One letter more I imagine will rid you of further trouble from this
quarter; expect then attacks from another: but look to JESUS; he will
make you more than conqueror. I thank thee, holy Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,
and revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good
in thy sight. Why me, LORD? why me? A sense of this distinguishing love
will make you laugh at all that men or devils can say of or do unto
you. Good night. I must away and pray for you. To-morrow Mr. ――――, &c.
breakfast with me. GOD bless you! Be of good courage: give no way, no
not for a moment.

               Ever yours, &c. &c. in an almighty JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Tommy_,

I AM sorry to hear you have been sick. This hath been my case. Blessed
be GOD, I am better. Who knows but I may be strengthened to take a
trip to _Scotland_. This itch after itinerating, I hope will never be
cured till we come to heaven. Though laymen occupy both the pulpits,
at _Tottenham-Court_ chapel and tabernacle, congregations increase.
“Not by might or by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD.” No weapon
formed against _Sion_, shall or can prosper. Our _Thursday_ morning six
o’clock tabernacle lecture is crouded. I am looking for, and putting
together old letters. Have you any dated _January_ or _February 1743_?
Could you send to Mr. _E――――s_ of _Ebly_, and enquire how Mrs. _L――――e_
may be directed to? Her husband had many letters from me. How are dear
Mrs. _R――――ts_, and Mrs. _A――――re_? I never forget them in the midst
of all my loves. I hope you are surrounded with warm friends, a most
kind and affectionate nurse, and what is all in all, an infinitely
compassionate never-failing JESUS. To his unchangeable love I most
earnestly commend your whole self, and all dear never to be forgotten
friends. How is poor Mr. _C――――e_? What an hospital is the church!
Blessed be GOD, there are no incurables in it however. Ere long,
we shall be where the inhabitants shall no more say, “I am sick.”
_Hallelujah._ I am, my very dear _Tommy_,

                      Yours, &c. &c. &c. in Him,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Sir_,

MR. ―――― hath just now been with me, and shewed me your letter,
expecting also a sight of mine. But my letters are brought late,
and to-morrow I go to preach at Lady _F――――y S――――y_’s. I therefore,
though quite ill, must send you a few lines now. Go to JESUS; learn to
pray of the threatened apostles, _viz._ “And now, LORD, behold their
threatenings, &c. &c.” I am afraid they will only threaten. If an
expulsion should be permitted, it will take place, I believe, only for
a little time, and soon be repented of. Thousands of prayers were put
up for you last _Monday_, at tabernacle letter-day. The verses were
these:

              Give him thy strength, O GOD of pow’r,
              Then let men rage and devils roar;
              Thy faithful witness he shall be;
              ’Tis fix’d, he can do all through Thee.
                                                Adieu.――

                            Ever yours, &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

THROUGH the tender mercies of our GOD, we arrived here last night about
six o’clock. In the way, I was enabled to preach both at _Northampton_
and _Sheffield_. Good seasons! The _Americans_ were gone the day
before I arrived at the last place; I missed them by coming through
_Chesterfield_ instead of _Mansfield_. All for the best. GOD willing, I
stay here over _Sunday_; perhaps longer. I have seen Mr. _T―――― G――――_;
he seems poorly. Happy they who work for JESUS while it is day! The
night of sickness cometh, when no man can work. LORD, help me to begin
to begin! I have seen but few yet, having desired that no company might
come the last night; by that means I got a little rest, and have now
time to write these few lines. O for heaven! Come LORD JESUS, come
quickly! In my next you will know where to direct. In the mean while,
be pleased to remember me to all at tabernacle, and all enquiring
friends, and accept of love unfeigned, from, my dear old steady friend,

                     Yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Newcastle, September 20, 1767._

_My dear very dear Friend_,

PREACHING and travelling prevent writing. Through unmerited mercy, I
am well. Upon the maturest deliberation, after earnest prayer, and for
several peculiar reasons, which you shall know hereafter, I decline
going to _Scotland_ this fall. I have now a blessed methodist field
street-preaching plan before me. This afternoon in the _Castle-Garth_,
to-morrow for _Sunderland_, next day at Mr. _R――――_’s mother’s door,
then to _Yarm_, &c. &c. You may venture to direct for me at Mr.
_William Shent_’s, peruke-maker, at _Leeds_, though I hope to find
a letter when I come there, and to hear all is well. But send me
no bad news, unless absolutely necessary. Let me enjoy myself in my
delightful itineracy. It is good, both for my body and soul. I have
been enabled to preach in the street, at several places, and hope to
go to _Gesborough_, _Whitby_, _Scarborough_, _New Malton_, _York_,
_Leeds_, _Liverpool_, _Chester_, _Manchester_, &c. &c. You shall know
particulars as we go on. Do not forget the society sermon. If it could
be deferred till the beginning of _November_, I might preach. If not,
drop it. Tender love to all friends. Golden seasons, golden seasons!
Grace, grace! I hope to write to the tabernacle next post. Cease not
to pray for,

                    Ever yours, &c. &c. in CHRIST,

                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Thirsk, September 28, 1767._

_My dear Friend_,

NEVER was I so long a stranger to _London_ affairs before. But being
detained here, by the persuasion of friends, an express is gone to
fetch what letters may have been sent to _Leeds_. I want to know the
determination about the society sermon, and what part of the paragraph
is true, about the commitment of several persons for a certain robbery.
I hope that death will not be the consequence to any of the criminals.
Father, convict and convert them, for thy infinite mercy’s sake! I
should be glad to ramble till their trial was over. I trust there will
be no necessity of my appearing in person. To-morrow, GOD willing,
as he earnestly desires to see me, I go to Doctor _C――――_’s. Where
the next remove will be, I know not. Be pleased to direct to _Leeds_.
My body feels much fatigue in travelling; comforts in the soul
over-balance. Every stage, more and more convinces me, that old
methodism is the thing. _Hallelujah!_ Come LORD, come! Tender love to
all. Is dear Mr. _H――――y_ come out of _Wales_? An answer to this, and
every question, is requested by, my dear friend,

              Yours, &c. &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friends_,

GRACE, mercy and peace, be multiplied upon you and yours, through JESUS
CHRIST our LORD. Our LORD! Our GOD! Glorious words, glorious thought,
glorious feeling, glorious experience! Enough to make us rejoice with
joy unspeakable; even with a joy that is full of glory.

                          O glorious King,
                          Us thither bring,
                          To kiss thy feet.

O to be instrumental in bringing some with us! This excursion, I trust,
will be over-ruled for that blessed purpose. I have been enabled to go
forth into the highways and hedges, into the lanes and streets, of the
towns and cities. Good old work, good old seasons! Help, help to praise
Him, whose mercy endureth for ever! Get honest _Betty W――――d_ to join
in putting up a word for her poor old master, but for JESUS CHRIST’s
sake, my dear friends,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

YOUR letter to Mr. _Shent_ reached me yesterday at _Thirsk_, and
hastened me hither. That from _A―――― B――――_, I almost impatiently wait
for. Blessed be GOD, that matters go on so well in town. It is the
same to the LORD, to save by few as by many. Not by might or by power,
but by his spirit, all things are to be brought about. By his divine
permission, I purpose preaching the society sermon. It may be on the
_Wednesday_ or _Thursday_ before the 31st of this month. I purpose
being in town the 22d or 23d. But why should not the sermon be preached
at tabernacle? Is not the feast to be kept at that end of the town?
Are not the major part of the society dissenters? Is there not to be
a collection? Excuse haste; my tender love to all. You may yet direct
to _Leeds_. Captain _Scot_ preaches this evening. Cease not to pray for
one, who doth not deserve the rank of a common soldier in CHRIST’s army.
His name is, “Less than the least of all,” but

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My good Shunamite_,

JUST as your letter came, I was taking pen in hand, to send you a
few lines. What a mercy, when good news comes from town and country!
And what news so good, as that of the word of the LORD JESUS running
and being glorified? This hath been the case with the worthless,
but willing pilgrim. Every where the sound of his blessed Master’s
feet hath been heard behind him. Field and street preaching hath
rather bettered, than hurt his bodily health. But as the weather
begins to break, he must look towards winter quarters. This makes it
impracticable for him to go to _Madly_. It is too far distant. May
JESUS support the suffering martyr. He will, he will!

                He knows what sore temptations mean,
                For He hath felt the same.

I know this will find you a living martyr; a witness of the truths and
life of JESUS; the only preparative for dying a martyr. That whether
you live, you may live unto the LORD, or whether you die, you may die
unto the LORD, is the earnest prayer of, dear Mrs. _H――――e_,

                  Yours, &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. W――――y_,

HOW is death scattering his arrows all around us! even into our
houses. Perhaps, ere now, your dear yoke-fellow, as well as dear Mr.
_Langworthy_, and Mr. _Wright_’s mother, are laid in the silent grave.
Surely, the call to us is loud, yea very loud. Its language is quite
articulate. “Watch and pray, for ye know not at what day or hour the
Son of man cometh.” What is this world? nothing, less than nothing.
What is the other world? An eternity; an eternity of endless misery or
endless bliss. LORD JESUS, quicken our, at least my tardy pace! I see
more and more, that we have no time to trifle, to be light, foolish, or
worldly minded. A fever, a burning fever may come with a commission to
burn up our bodies. It spares neither Duke nor Prince. Happy they, whom
it finds burned up with the fever of divine love. That living and dying,
this may be your happy lot and frame, is the hearty prayer of, dear Mr.
_W――――y_,

          Your real friend and servant in the glorious JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Tommy_,

GOOD-morrow. This comes to enquire how you and yours do? I am just
returned from my northern circuit. It hath been pleasant, and I trust
profitable. Praise the LORD, O our souls! Every where the fields have
been white ready unto harvest. I am become a downright street and field
preacher. I wish the city, and want of riding, may not hurt me. No
nestling, no nestling on this side _Jordan_. Heaven is the believer’s
only resting place. There we shall not be disturbed. I do not know but
Mr. _Winter_ will get there soon. At present he is very ill. But he
that bringeth down to the grave, can bring up again. You and I know
this by repeated experience. But we shall not always put out to sea
again and again. _Hallelujah._ Come LORD, come! How is Mr. _C――――m_? Is
he near the haven, or kept back by cross winds? Write me an answer to
all the above interrogatories; especially to those concerning yourself.
Tender love to all. Mr. _Wright_ joins in sending cordial respects. Mr.
_J――――s_ hath been much blessed here. That the GOD and Father of our
LORD JESUS CHRIST may bless you and yours evermore, heartily prays, my
very dear _Tommy_,

            Ever yours, &c. &c. in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Sir_,

BY your brother _Peter_’s letter, the hour of expulsion is not yet come.
Surely they will not be so imprudent, or act so contrary to the laws
of _English_ liberty. I long to know what statutes they say you have
broken, what concessions have been made. Your diocesan will make a
strict enquiry. I wish you could recollect all circumstances; the rise
and progress of the present contest; with all the various pleadings,
threats, conferences, _pro_ and _con_. The issue of the trial you may
leave to the Judge; he is always the injured prisoners friend. If
confined to college, this will be a good exercise for you. You may
lodge it in court, as a proof whether you understand to write plain
_English_, or sound, practical, experimental divinity. This can do you
no harm; it may do good. Do therefore set about it. I know one who will
readily revile and correct, if necessary. The LORD JESUS be with your
spirits! You see how I write, out of the fulness of my heart. Sick
suffering soldiers must be attended. If ever so busy, for the sake of
the glorious Captain of our salvation, you shall receive a line by way
of answer from, my dear Sir,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ I shall send the original to your _Fidus Achates_, in ――――, but
I shall keep a copy. Who knows? _Sauls_ may yet become _Pauls_.

_My very dear Tommy_,

WAS not Mrs. _J――――s_ very near her time, and her husband consequently
thereby detained in town, you would herewith receive a mandamus to
come up to court. The first vacancy you may depend upon. In the mean
while, may the country all round about ring of, “Come to JESUS, come
to JESUS.” Worthy Sir _Charles H――――m_ hath received a call indeed.
He slept in JESUS about a fortnight ago, near the _Spa_, in _Germany_.
Happy translation! We must follow by and by. Some ascend, some descend
the heavenly ladder. All will, ere long, sit down with Him, who stands
at the top to receive poor pilgrims. _Hallelujah! Hosanna!_ Good
morning to you and yours. Hearty love to all. I wish I knew where Mrs.
_R――――s_ sojourns. I would send her an invitation, or wait upon her in
person. Wait, wait; we shall certainly see the salvation of GOD. But
_Isaacs_ must be sacrificed, before they can be received from the dead.
Thus faith is tried. Thus the believer is prepared for a “now know I
that thou lovest me.” Adieu! I must away. My very dear _Tommy_,

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Sir_,

SUPPOSING you made this addition to the motto of your coat of arms,
_Nemo me impune lacessit_? He that toucheth GOD’s people, toucheth the
apple of GOD’s eye. That is a very tender part. I am glad your diocesan
is expected soon. I have no suspicion of his beating a retreat. “To
arms, to arms,” must be the watch word now. It was the constancy of
the three children, (the three heroes) that confounded their enemies.
The company of the Son of man is never so sweet, as when he walks with
us in the fiery furnace, never so glorious, as when he is seen keeping
his honest _Daniels_ company in a den of lions. You have therefore your
answers ready, “We are not careful about this matter; we will not bow
down to the golden image which _Nebuchadnezzar_ hath set up; the GOD
whom we serve is able to deliver us.” If you do not like these examples,
take _Peter_ and _John_. Suppose dear ―――― to be _John_, and ―――― to
be _Peter_. You know how the high-priests addressed them, you know
their answer. By their answer, by their boldness, they took notice that
they had been with JESUS. Nothing, nothing can stand before an honest
truly _Israelitish_ heart. But this is enough for a sick-bed lecture. I
would only add, that those who endeavour to entangle CHRIST’s followers
in their talk, will in the end be entangled themselves. Good-morning
to you all. Remember the watch word. Stand out your full time in
guard-hours, send word at about what distance the enemy keeps, or how
near he approaches, or what further feint attacks he makes, and, GOD
willing, you shall hear again from,

             Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our LORD, GOD almighty,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

I WISH some one hour could be fixed for the triumvirate, to meet once
a week. Some business might then be done for both ends of the town.
Regular dispatch is beautiful. What your hand findeth to do, do it with
all your might, &c. I would settle every thing; perhaps I may be called
suddenly, as well as ――――. Transporting thought! Come, LORD JESUS, come
quickly. I would reflect upon _Wednesday_ with humility and gratitude¹.
LORD, what am I? “Less than the least of all,” must be my motto still.
I hope you have got the better of your pleasing fatigue. What an honour
to do any thing for JESUS! in Him, I am, my dear friend,

                          Ever yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Sir_,

ALL know my mind. Go forward, I think is the royal word of command.
We may then indeed have a red-sea to pass through. But the threatening
waves shall become a wall on the right hand and on the left. I am
ashamed to find so many silenced by mere _Bruta Fulmina_. But I have
done. If you will be more particular about the uproar, or if at any
time you have a mind to unburden your heart, and let me know how you go
forward, as business permits, you shall hear from me. Nothing but want
of time hath prevented my answering you before. You will receive it in
love, and be as serviceable as you can to the bearer of this, who is
a brother to the late seraphic _H――――y_, and comes to settle his two
sons, but is not fixed as to college or tutor. May they turn out two
_H――――y_’s! May you be a burning and shining light! No greater honour
can be desired for you, by, my dear Sir,

               Yours, &c. &c. in a never-failing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

NONE but GOD knows what a concern lies upon me now, in respect to
_Bethesda_. Friends can guess, and a little sympathize, and I thank
them for it; but the Friend of sinners alone can shew what is to be
done. At present, as to this particular, I walk in darkness, and have
no light. In other respects, blessed be GOD, the light shines as at
noon-day. Grace, grace! As another voyage perhaps may be the issue
and result of all at last, I would beg you and my dear Mr. _H――――y_
to let me have my papers and letters, that I may revise and dispose
of them in a proper manner. This can do no hurt, come life or come
death, or whether I stay at home or go abroad. Thanks be to GOD for a
disinterested spirit. Though in helping others we fetter ourselves, yet
in the end all will be well. I wait for thy salvation O LORD! In Him, I
am, my dear Sir,

                        Yours, &c. &c. &c. &c.

_Dear Sir_,

_QUANTUM mutatus ab illo!_ As you now do not suffer outwardly, I expect
to hear that you suffer inwardly. Nothing else can preserve you this
winter season, or prepare you for another spring. A spring, I trust,
you will yet have. Then shall poor _Sampson_’s locks grow again, and
he be revenged of the _Philistines_ for the loss of his eyes. Surely
you have been wrong advised. _Exitus acta probat._ If you chuse to
have our correspondence continued, write your whole heart; it may help
to unload it. I shall not upbraid; though I do not expect letters now
will smell of the divine fire as formerly. Well, if they smell of the
prison of humiliation, by and by they may regain their usual and more
solid permanent fervor. But, _facilis descensus Averni_.――You meet
like apostles now; but when they met between the time of their LORD’s
death and resurrection, what trouble did they endure, for fear of the
_Jews_? But be not discouraged. Continue instant in prayer. A risen, an
ascended JESUS will yet appear in the midst of you, (though the doors
of your hearts may be now shut) renew your commission, endue you with
power from on high; and then, woe be to the _Jewish_ sanhedrim. O think
of this, ye little college of cast-outs! Do not deny him in any wise.
You see I write to you out of the fulness of my heart. The LORD bless
you and keep you; the LORD lift up the light of his countenance upon
you, and be gracious unto you; the LORD cause his face to shine upon
you, and then, but not till then, will you have peace.

                            Yours, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Dear Mr. ―――― must hear from me next. GOD bring all your souls
out of prison. Amen and amen.

                                            _Bath, December 8, 1767._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

HOW glad was I to hear by the _London Shunamite_, that you and your
Lady were well; that GOD had given you a son; that you reflected on
your preaching at _Tottenham-Court_ chapel with pleasure; that you
had gotten a curate; and, to compleat all, that you intended to visit
_England_ next spring. This news rejoiced me before I left town, and
was most grateful to our good Lady _H――――n_, whom I have the honour
of waiting upon at this time in _Bath_. She hath been sick, nigh unto
death, but through mercy is now somewhat recovered, though as yet
unable to write much. This her Ladyship much regrets on your account;
and therefore enjoins me to inform your whole self, that your letter
did not reach her hands till many weeks after the proper time; that
ever since she hath been visited with lingering sickness, but begs
you will not linger in coming over to our _Macedonia_ to help us. The
thought of it seems to refresh her heaven-born soul. Blessed be GOD,
her Ladyship still takes the lead. She is now doing honour to the
remains of the Earl of _B――――n_, who sweetly slept in JESUS last week.
His corpse lies deposited in her Ladyship’s chapel, and is not to be
removed till next _Friday_ morning. There have been public prayers
and preaching twice every day. The noble relatives constantly attend,
and all is more than solemn. Great numbers of all ranks croud to see
and hear; I trust many will also feel. The deceased Earl died like
the patriarch _Jacob_; he laid his hands on, and blessed his children,
assured them of his personal interest in JESUS, called most gloriously
on the Holy Ghost; cried, Happy! happy! as long as he could speak, and
then――You know what followed. I know how you and yours will improve
this imperfect account, and therefore hasten to subscribe myself, dear
and honoured friends,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCLXXX.


                        _To Lady S―――― S――――._

                                            _Bath, December 9, 1767._

_Honoured Madam_,

ALL hath been awful, and more than awful. On _Saturday_ evening, before
the corpse was taken from _B――――n-House_, a word of exhortation was
given, and a hymn sung in the room where the corpse lay. The young Earl
stood with his hands on the head of the coffin, the Countess Dowager
on his right hand, Lady _Ann_ and Lady _Isabella_ on his left, and
their brother _Thomas_ next to their mother, with Miss _O――――n_, Miss
_Wh――――r_, Miss _G――――e_; on one side all domestics, with a few friends
on the other. The word of exhortation was received with great solemnity,
and most wept under the parting prayer. At ten the corpse was removed
to good Lady _H――――n_’s chapel, where it was deposited within a place
railed in for that purpose, covered with black bays, and the usual
funeral concomitants, except escutcheons. On _Sunday_ morning, all
attended in mourning at early sacrament. They were seated by themselves,
at the feet of the corpse, and with their head servants, received first,
and a particular address was made to them. Immediately after receiving,
these verses were sung for them:

              Our lives, our blood, we here present,
              If for thy truths they may be spent:
              Fulfil thy sovereign counsel, LORD;
              Thy will be done, thy name ador’d.

              Give them thy strength, O GOD of power,
              Then let men rave or devils roar;
              Thy faithful witnesses they’ll be;
              ’Tis fix’d, they can do all through Thee.

Then they received this blessing, “The LORD bless you and keep you, the
LORD lift up the light of his countenance upon you, the LORD cause his
face to shine upon you, and give you peace,” and so returned to their
places. Sacrament ended (and a blessed sacrament it was) the Noble
Mourners returned to good Lady _H――――n_’s house, which was lent them
for the day. At eleven, public service begun. The bereaved relations
sat in order within, and the domestics around the outside of the rail.
The chapel was more than crouded. Near three hundred tickets signed
by the present Earl, were given out to the nobility and gentry, to
be admitted. All was hush’d and solemn. Proper hymns were sung, and I
preached on these words, “I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me,
write, blessed are the dead that die in the LORD.” Attention sat on
every face, and deep and almost universal impressions were made. The
like scene, and if possible more solemn, was exhibited in the evening,
and I was enabled to preach a second time, and a like power attended
the word as in the morning. Ever since, there hath been public service
and preaching twice a day. This is to be continued till _Friday_
morning, then all is to be removed to _Bristol_, in order to be shipped
off for _Scotland_. The inscription on the coffin runs thus;

  “His life was honourable,――his death blessed,――he sought
  earnestly peace with GOD,――he found it with unspeakable joy
  alone in the merits of CHRIST JESUS, witnessed by the holy
  Spirit to his soul,――he yet speaketh.――Go thou and do likewise.”

I have oftened wished for your Ladyship here. Congregations are very
large, attentive, and deeply impressed. Surely the death of this
noble Earl, thus improved, will prove the life of many. He had great
foretastes of heaven, cried, “Come Holy Ghost;” he came, and filled
him with joy unspeakable. Happy, happy, were his last dying words.
All surviving relatives still feel the influence. They sit round the
corpse attended by their domestics and supporters twice a day. Good
Lady _S――――x_ gets fresh spirits. She loves your Ladyship dearly. I am
called to attend, and therefore must hasten to acknowledge innumerable
obligations, and to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

                     Your Ladyship’s, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCLXXXI.


                                        _Bristol, December 12, 1767._

_My dear Captain_,

I HOPE this will find you rejoicing with trembling, on account
of an additional careful comfort. Thus it must be in this mixed
state of things. Yet a little while, and our joy will be permanent,
uninterrupted, and without alloy. For five days together we have been
attending at the house of mourning. Many, I trust, were obliged to
say, “How dreadful is this place.” Such a like scene, I never expect
to see opened again on this side eternity. All is quiet, I trust, with
you. But if diamond hath been cutting diamond, it will only be suitable
to a church militant here on earth. Blessed be GOD for an almighty
JESUS! who can by these mutual cuttings prepare the jewels for their
respective places in the intended crown. Ere long he will count them up.
Not one shall be wanting. Cordial love to all. I purpose being in town
_Tuesday_ se’nnight in the evening. Brethren, pray for us. I shall make
all easy at _Kingswood_ before I leave _Bristol_. That you may shine

_My dear Friend_,

WE have been favoured with golden seasons here. I have been enabled
to preach thrice, and to administer the holy sacrament. Thousands
went away on _Sunday_, because they could not come in. The word hath
been attended with great power. Grace! grace! What a pity that we
cannot stay a week or two longer! But I must away to _Bath_ to preach
to-morrow, and the next Lord’s-day. Shall write, GOD willing, to Mr.
_S――――s_ by _Saturday_’s post, to tell _Rose_ where to meet me with the
chaise. We come in the two days post-coach. Mr. _A――――s_ is come hither
to see me. I thought to have brought him up with me, but the coach was
full. Is it true, that Mr. _J――――ss_ hath two careful comforts at once?
I wish him much joy. Pray tell my wife, that I intend doing myself
the pleasure of dining at Tabernacle-house next _Wednesday_. Ere long
we shall sit down and eat bread in the kingdom of heaven. _Hallelujah!
hallelujah!_ Come, LORD, come. Hearty love to all. Continue to pray for,
my dear friend,

                Yours and dear Mr. _H――――y_’s, &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCLXXXIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                         _London, December 28, 1767._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

WHY do you and I exchange letters so seldom? Perhaps it would be better
to correspond more frequently. This brings you the good news of the
triumphant death of the late Earl of _B――――n_. He behaved like the
patriarch _Jacob_, when by faith leaning upon his staff, he blessed
his children. The Earl added, “Yea, and they shall be blessed.” “Had
I strength of body, (cried the Earl) I would not be ashamed before men
and angels to tell what the LORD JESUS hath done for my soul. Come,
holy Ghost, come, holy Ghost; happy, happy, happy!” and then sweetly
slept in JESUS. The present noble Earl, I believe, hath got the
blessing indeed, and seems, upon the best evidence, to determine to
know nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified. He hath behaved in
the most delicate manner to the Countess, and other noble survivors. He
stands here in town, against all opposition, like an impregnable rock;
and I humbly hope will prove the _Daniel_ of the age. He must be, nay
he hath been already thrown into a den of lions; but he hath one with
him, that stops the lions mouths. You will encourage all GOD’s people
to pray for him. What if you wrote him a line? I am sure it will
be taken kindly; for I know he honours and loves you much. You will
communicate this to dear Mr. _M――――ch_, who, I suppose, like me, is
groaning, being burdened. I am now fifty-three years old. Did you ever
hear of such a fifty-three years old barren fig-tree? So much digging,
so much dunging, and yet so little fruit. GOD be merciful to me a
sinner! A sinner――a sinner――a sinner. He is merciful; he is gracious:
his mercy endureth for ever. He yet vouchsafes to bless my feeble
labours. You would have been delighted to have seen the awful scene
exhibited at _Bath_, whilst the late noble Earl lay in state. Two
sermons every day; life and power attended the word; and I verily
believe many dead souls were made to hear the voice of the Son of GOD.
Since that we have been favoured with comfortable seasons in town. I
hope you are blessed in _Glasgow_. Who knows but we may have one more
interview in Spring? Whether we meet next on earth or in heaven, you
will find that with great sincerity I subscribe myself, reverend and
very dear Sir,

               Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our glorious JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _London, February 4, 1768._

_My dear Sir_,

WHO would but converse when together, like persons that may never meet
again till launched into an endless eternity. I hope this was in some
measure our case, when we dined lately at Mr. _H――――t_’s. One of the
company, I find, is gone, and I trust to eat bread in the kingdom of
heaven.

                    She is happy now, and we
                    Soon her happiness shall see.

In the midst of all your sorrow for the loss of so near and dear
a relation, methinks such a consideration may make you cry out,
_Hallelujah! Amen! Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly_. Blessed be GOD,
our turn will come by and by. Be ye also ready, is the loud call of
the present afflictive providence. That it may be duly heard, and
practically applied, is the hearty prayer of

       Your sympathizing friend, and servant in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friends_,

IF you choose it, you may now be released; but the aspect of affairs
at home, is by no means promising. Many, many think of going abroad.
However, you will be so kind as to see the bearers of this settled
before you remove. Mr. _C――――ne_, a worthy disinterested creature,
is to be steward of the house: he is a particular heart-friend of Mr.
_W――――t_’s. Mr. _W――――t_’s sister is an approved housekeeper, and the
little female orphans are to be committed to her care. Mr. _L――――y_
hath had an university education, is a good writer and accomptant,
hath been with me some time, and is to be a school-master. I long to
know how poor _Peter_ and _Ephraim_ go on, and likewise his sister at
_Savannah_. I and Mr. _W――――t_ hope to follow soon. But future things
belong to Him who orders all things well. I believe; LORD, help my
unbelief. His work prospers. That is all in all. Be pleased to have all
accounts settled and audited, and take what you please for your passage,
if determined to return. But――but――GOD keep you, through too fond
affection, from taking a false step! My heart is full. If you come away,
and Mr. _S――――k_ also goes away, I would have a letter of attorney
given to Mr. _C――――ne_. But it would be well if I could hear from you
first. GOD direct and bless you all. I can only commend you to GOD
and the word of his grace, and with ten thousand thanks for all your
labours of love, subscribe myself, very dear friends,

               Yours, &c. &c. &c. in our glorious JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, May 17, 1768._

_My dear Man_,

GO forward, go forward, is the watch-word of the present day. Never
mind the envious cry of elder brethren. Had they been harkened to,
the prodigal must never have come home, nor _Goliah_’s head have been
cut off. All temple builders, especially when called out to work in
the field, must endure not only the contradictions of sinners, but the
contradiction of saints also. Happy are they who are so deeply engaged
in building, as not to have time to hearken to either. I long to come
and lend an helping, though feeble hand. But _Welch_ horses move slowly.
If the _Welch_ apostle comes, I purpose, in the _Whitsun_ week, to make
a short excursion into _Sussex_ and _Kent_, and then for _Bristol_.
Blessed be GOD, the shout of a king is heard in our camps! All your
family is well. All will be more than well, when we come to our house
in heaven. Let us march forward with palms of victory in our hands,
crying, “_Hallelujah!_ the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth!” Tender love
to all. I hope to answer Mrs. _R――――s_ person. The LORD JESUS be with
your spirits! Cease not to pray for, my dear man,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

I HOPE this will find you and yours safe returned to _London_. I am
glad to hear by dear Mr. _H――――_, that you left your daughter better:
may she be spared, not in judgment, but in mercy! Then all will be
well: nay, at all events, you may be assured all shall work for good,
because you love GOD. Glorious assurance this! Thanks be to GOD for
this unspeakable gift. Thanks be to his great name, for ordering my
steps this way. You would be delighted to see our Orphan-house park
assemblies; as large, attentive, and affectionate as ever. Twenty-seven
year old friends and spiritual children, remember the days of old; they
are seeking after their first love, and there seems to be a stirring
among the dry bones. I cannot yet tell when I shall move. Probably
within this fortnight. I must away to my throne. Love to all at
Tabernacle, and to all that are so kind as to enquire after,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Timothy_,

I AM much obliged to you for staying at _London_, till I return from
_Scotland_. My journey hither was certainly of GOD. Could I preach ten
times a day, thousands and thousands would attend. I have been confined
for a few days, but on _Monday_ or _Tuesday_ next hope to mount my
throne again. O to die there! Too great, too great an honour to be
expected. My wife will see my letter to Mr. _S――――ks_. I thank her for
her kind letter just received. Pray tell Mr. _K――――n_ that no _Indian_
money will be remitted to the _London_ trust from hence. The interest
of what is collected, which is near two thousand pounds, is to be sent,
as occasion requires, to Mr. _Wheelock_ and the _Connecticut_ trust. Be
pleased to send to Mr. _Dilly_, and desire him to forward by the first
ship, fifty of my letters to the Archbishop, directed to Mr. _Herdie_
at the custom-house, _Leith_. I am here only in danger of being hugged
to death. Friends of all ranks seem heartier and more friendly than
ever. All is of grace. Grace! grace! I thought to write you a long
letter: but company forbids. I go on in my old way, without turning to
the right hand or to the left. Providence says every day, “This is the
way, walk in it.” Tender love to all, particularly to my dear wife.
Next post she may expect to hear from,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Edinburgh, July 4, 1768._

_My dear Friend_,

WHAT various interruptions do we meet with in this lower world!
Sickness, preaching, and company, have prevented my answering your
kind letter more speedily. I strive to stir and fly as formerly; but
the earthly house of this tabernacle pulls me down.

              Strange, that a harp of thousand strings,
              Should keep in tune so long!

However, this is my comfort, the Redeemer still vouchsafes to smile
upon my feeble efforts. In _London_ the word runs and is glorified,
and in _Edinburgh_, I trust, the prospect is promising. The fields are
white ready unto harvest. Who knows but some wheat may be gathered into
the heavenly garner? Many of my old friends are safely housed.

                  They are happy now, and we
                  Soon their happiness shall see.
                                        Hallelujah!

Perhaps we may have one interview. I have thoughts of going to _M――――_.
A week or a fortnight, at most, is the longest time I can stay here. I
desire to move, till I can move no more. O to die in the field! I pray
GOD to send Mrs. _T――――_ a safe delivery. My wife is as well as can be
expected. Both descending in order to ascend

                Where sin and pain and sorrow cease,
                And all is calm and joy and peace.

I add one more _hallelujah_; and must hasten to subscribe myself, my
dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

_My very dear Friend_,

GOD be praised that all is so well at _London_. Every thing goes on
better and better here. But I am so worn down by preaching abroad, and
by talking at home almost all the day long, that I have determined, GOD
willing, to set off for _London_ next _Tuesday_ noon. I shall mind all
you say. You have acted quite right. As you do not mention my wife, I
suppose she is out of town. GOD prepare you and yours for whatever he
hath prepared for you, and support you under your present and impending
trial. Company prevents my enlarging. Thus it is continually. Grace!
grace! Hoping to see you soon, with tender love to all, I beg leave to
subscribe myself, my dear friend,

                        Ever yours, &c. &c. &c.

_Dear Mr. J――――ss_,

BLESSED be the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who hath so
mercifully preserved you in your going out and coming in, and caused
you to triumph in every place! You may continue your gospel range, till
Mr. _E――――ds_ leaves _London_; then we must think of Winter quarters.
Let us work whilst it is day. The late very unexpected breach, is a
fresh proof that the night soon cometh when no man can work¹. Pray
where may I find that grand promise made to _Abraham_ after _Sarah_’s
death? May it be fulfilled in you, whilst your _Sarah_ is yet alive!
Sweet bereavements, when GOD himself fills up the chasm! Through mercy
I find it so. Adieu. Tender love to all. Brethren, pray for us. I
suppose I must direct to brother _Adams_ at _Rodborough_. He expects
you there. That you may be owned in every place more and more, heartily
prays, my dear man,

                     Yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

I HAVE had the return of my old disorder; but blessed be GOD, I am
strengthened to preach the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. We
reached _Gloucester_ on _Monday_, and came hither on _Wednesday_
afternoon. All we have met with exceeds description. Early next
_Monday_ I purpose to set off for _Bristol_, and soon after shall
return to _London_. Brethren, pray for us. I believe you do; for GOD is
with us of a truth. I hope you and yours are supported. The Redeemer is
a present help in every time of need. Cordial respects await all that
love him in sincerity. Mr. _L――――d_ and a _Londonner_ left us to-day.
I hope Mr. _P――――d_ and _B――――s_ make all possible dispatch. GOD send
dear Mr. _H――――y_ a good passage and safe return! _Amen! Amen!_ LORD,
quicken my tardy pace!

                       Ever yours, &c. in JESUS,

_My very dear Friend_,

WHAT we have seen and felt at the college is unspeakable. Through mercy
last night we came hither. My disorder has returned. This may hasten
me up: or rather hasten me to heaven. I hope your daughter will have it
revealed _in her_ before she goes hence. That is all in all. Is there
any thing too hard for the LORD?

                  Surely, O GOD, thy grace is free,
                  For, O my GOD, it found out ME!

In a day’s time my rout may be determined. _P――――d_, &c. must make
haste. Captain _J――――ss_ comes up at the appointed time. Hearty love
awaits dear Mr. _E――――s_, &c. &c. &c. Cease not to pray for, my very
dear friend,

                       Yours, &c. &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Since writing the above I received yours. I find the threatened
blow is given. I hope _both_ are enabled to say, “The LORD hath given,
and the LORD hath taken away: and blessed be the name of the LORD.”
Be pleased to send what letters you have for me, and accept these few
lines of condolance from, my dear Sir,

             Yours, &c. &c. in an all-compassionate JESUS,

_My very dear Mr. D――――n_,

I WAS exceeding glad to find, by your last kind favour, that you and
Mrs. _D――――n_ thought of deferring your embarkation for _England_
till the Spring. You will then see the newcomers quite settled, and I
wish I could add, see also your reasons for leaving _Bethesda_ but of
little weight. I know your mind. Would to GOD your dear yoke-fellow
was like-minded. She will certainly be so very soon after her arrival
in her native country: but I would not grieve her. GOD bless you both!
_Brownhill_’s situation I much approve of. Poor _Peter_ often engages
my thoughts. It pleases me to find that he goes on well; but I want to
have him settled. If not likely to make a scholar, or be in some good
station in the house, I wish he was put out to some proper business.
Not one prize as yet among all the young relations I have endeavoured
to provide for. Father, not my but thy sovereign will be done! I
wish you could enquire what is become of ――――, sent over with Mr.
_Wooldridge_, Provost-Marshall at _Augustine_. You may guess that I
long to see the accompts. I doubt not of their being quite compleat.
Could you not send me a duplicate before your intended embarkation, it
would be very acceptable for many reasons. All your dear relations on
this side the water are well. My nearest relation hath been quite well
above a month. Mr. _Middleton_ hath soon followed after. His wife died
a few weeks before him.

                  They are happy now, and we
                  Soon their happiness shall see.

_Hallelujah! Hallelujah!_ Come, LORD, come! Praying still that, if it
be the divine will, you may be constrained to abide at _Bethesda_, I
subscribe myself, dear and faithful friends,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

_My very dear Friend_,

WHY should not one invalid write to another? What if we should meet
in our way to heaven unembodied, and consequently freed from every
thing that at present weighs down our precious and immortal souls? But
perhaps we are yet to sojourn a little longer on earth. For these two
days past, I have been unable almost to write. To-day I am what they
call better, and must improve my first strength in sending a few lines
to him whom I dearly love in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. May they find
you and your dear partner leaning on his bosom, who alone is able to
bring out of every wilderness. Neither are forgotten before his throne.
Though absent in body, I am present in spirit. Accept of love and
sympathy unfeigned. I am persuaded you are not unmindful of, very dear
friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXCVI.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                        _London, September 19, 1768._

_My dear Sir_,

I APPROVE very much of Mr. _Brooksbank_’s motion, especially as dear
Mr. _Middleton_ is gone. His burying is fixed for _Wednesday_ evening.
Would you choose (with some other friends to whom I shall write) to
condescend to be a pallbearer. The conference to follow the children
as mourners. The children to be sent for in my carriage, and sit with
the pall bearers in my parlour. All to be invited that have a mind to
follow in mourning. The corpse to be brought privately to Tabernacle on
_Tuesday_ night. I must away, for fear of the evening air. I should be
glad to see you at _Tottenham-Court_ to-morrow afternoon. By that time,
I shall know Dr. _C――――r_’s answer to Mr. _Middleton_’s daughter’s
letter. By which we shall judge the better how to act, in regard to
opening the intended subscription for the benefit of his fatherless
children. Blessed be GOD, I am better, but am ordered to decline
preaching. GOD’s will be done! Pray let Mrs. _K――――n_ make free at
Tabernacle-house as usual. GOD bless you both! GOD give me patience
to wait till my change comes! I am, my dear friend,

         Yours most affectionately in our glorious _Emmanuel_,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXCVII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― S――――._

                                        _London, September 26, 1768._

_My very dear Friend_,

BLESSED be GOD for the art of writing! blessed be GOD for skill to read
and understand what is written! Thus we understand each other, though
at a thousand miles distance; thus I understand, and by understanding
learn to sympathize with my dear fellow-sufferer Mr. _S――――_. This is
my comfort, that underneath him are the almighty Redeemer’s everlasting
arms. Therefore, being the beloved of the LORD, he must dwell in safety.
Though prevented by the weather from using or drinking the _Ramsgate_
waters, nothing can prevent his using or drinking the waters of life
freely. No, no: in every true believer’s heart the Holy Ghost is a
well of water springing up to life eternal. Hence it is, that though
he killeth, he maketh alive; though he wounds, yet he heals. These
words I was enabled to feel and enlarge upon yesterday morning from my
_Tottenham-Court_ throne. For some days the flux of blood hath stopped
entirely. Praise the LORD, O my soul! LORD JESUS, if it be thy blessed
will, let me hear of the recovery of my dear friend! Most cordial
respects attend dear Mrs. _S――――_. GOD bless, support, and comfort her
under her present circumstances. Mr. _Middleton_ is now made perfectly
whole. He was buried from the Tabernacle last _Wednesday_ evening,
and a subscription is opened for his four orphans. In the midst of his
torturing pains, being asked by his daughter how he was, he answered,
“A heaven upon earth.” Soon afterwards he fell asleep in JESUS. In Him
I am, my very dear dear Sir,

           Yours, yours, &c. &c. in our never-failing JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCXCVIII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                        _Bristol, November 12, 1768._

_My dear Mr. K――――n_,

THROUGH infinite mercy we arrived here in due season. Last night I
hope the Redeemer manifested forth his glory. GOD willing, I stay
till next _Thursday_ or _Friday_ morning. _Friday_ evening, and the
following _Sunday_, I shall preach at _Bath_. In three weeks expect
to reach _London_, except called before that period to reside at the
_New-Jerusalem_. The pleasing prospect lies day and night open before
me. On _Monday_, I suppose, dear Mr. _H――――y_ sets out for _Bath_.
All proper enquiry hath been made about his house. Particulars he will
be acquainted with on his arrival. Pray for me. _Bethesda_ lies upon
my heart night and day. Something must be determined speedily. As I
trust my eye is single, GOD will assuredly direct my goings in his
way. Hitherto he hath helped: he will do so to the end. _Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!_ GOD bless you and yours! Wonted cordial christian
salutations to all, who are so kind as to be concerned for, and enquire
after, my dear steady friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCXCIX.


                           _To Mr. A――――s._

                                         _London, November 30, 1768._

_My very dear Tommy_,

TEN thousand thanks for your kind sympathy. Many thought I should not
hold out from _Bath_ to _London_. But I cannot as yet go to him whom, I
trust, my soul loveth. Last _Sunday_ I creeped up to my gospel throne:
this evening the same honour is to be conferred upon me. Why me, LORD?
why me? The prayers of GOD’s people detain me here: for what end, the
event only can discover. To be tried, we may be assured. Mr. _W――――t_
is going with his brothers to _Georgia_, in order to finish the wings
of the intended college, and repair the present buildings. I suppose
they will sail in about a fortnight. You will pray that _Abraham_’s GOD
may be my GOD and my guide unto death. He will, he will.

                I would believe thy promise, LORD;
                LORD, help my unbelief.

Cordial, most cordial respects await your whole self, and all who are
so kind as to enquire after, my very dear _Tommy_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER MCCCC.


                        _To W―――― P――――, Esq._

                                         _London, December 14, 1768._

HOW unexpected a letter! what a kind present! Both came safe to hand;
both call for most grateful acknowledgments. My poor prayers shall
follow them: may they enter into the ears of the LORD of Sabaoth! They
will, they will. He is a GOD hearing prayer. You and yours know it;
otherwise how would you have been translated from darkness to light!
Marvellous, soul-transforming light! This, I trust, you prove by daily
experience, passing from glory to glory by the Spirit of the LORD.
Hence you increase in boldness; hence your readiness to follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth, though it should be without the camp. Blessed
be his name, for this honour conferred upon ill and hell-deserving
me. This may make dear Mr. _S――――t_ easy, should I ever be called to
_Shropshire_. I love the open bracing air. Preaching within doors is
apt to make us nervous, especially to crouded auditories. These, I hope,
he is blessed with. GOD make him a successful fisher of men! I hope he
and his are enabled to walk in all the ordinances and commandments of
the LORD blameless. Blessed saving fruits of a living faith! blessed
proofs of having our past sins forgiven! As for those to come, I
dare not to mention their being forgiven, till committed. _Moderate
Calvinism_ I take to be a medium between two extremes. I should not
choose to use expressions that need an apology. This seems to be a
blemish in Dr. _Caisp_, and other supralapsarian writers. A word to the
wise is enough. You will excuse this freedom, because it proceeds from
love unfeigned in, dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCCI.

_My dear Friend_,

YOU will see the contents of my letter to Dr. _E――――e_. I have
considered the affair of the picture. What think you? A limner who
lately drew me, and hung the picture up in the exhibition, asks forty
guineas for a copy. I shall not mind him, but send a bust taken several
years ago. It shall be paid for here, and presented as a token of
my hearty, hearty love to the Orphan-house at _Edinburgh_, and its
never-to-be-forgotten friends. Nothing but my disorder of body, GOD
willing, shall prevent my engagement in the plains of _Philippi_: But,
I fear, that will be an obstruction to so long a journey. You cannot
tell how low my late excursion only to _Bristol_ and _Bath_ brought me.
But I serve a GOD who killeth and maketh alive. I would leave future
events to Him, and like you merchants improve the present Now: time is
short; eternity is endless. The Judge hath sent this awful message,
“Behold, I come quickly.” That we all may be ready to go forth to meet
him, earnestly prays, my dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, December 29, 1768._

_My very dear Tommy_,

MANY thanks for your kind sympathetic congratulatory letter. Mr.
_Wright_ is gone, or rather lies yet in the _Downs_. He is gone
to build for Him, who shed his precious heart’s-blood for ill and
hell-deserving me. Whether the unworthy Founder lives or dies,
_Bethesda_ affair, I trust, will now be compleated. Strange, that I
am now living! Fifty-four years old last _Tuesday_. GOD be merciful to
me a sinner! a sinner! a sinner! Less than the least of all, must be
my motto still. As such, continue to pray for me. That you and yours,
and all the elect people of GOD around you, may increase with all the
increase of GOD, continually prays, my very dear _Tommy_,

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCIII.

                                          _London, January 13, 1769._

_My dear Sir_,

WITH regret I send the inclosed; but alas! they were borrowed. May
the prayers put up for the writers, enter into the ears of the LORD of
Sabaoth. They will, they will. And what then? What then? Why, they will
turn out good soldiers of JESUS CHRIST. That this may be their happy
lot, earnestly prays,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCCIV.

                                          _London, February 4, 1769._

_My dear Sir_,

I HOPE this will find you safe arrived at _Bath_, in your way to
_London_. I thank GOD that matters have turned out no worse at
_Plymouth_. I see more and more every day, that things and persons are
only what an all-wise, almighty JESUS is pleased to make them. Happy,
happy they that have their all in Him, who is indeed our All in All!
This, I believe, is your happy lot. Grace! grace! This may teach us
to look to JESUS in all our concerns and motions. What his will may
be concerning my voyage to _Georgia_, I know not. At present the cloud
doth not move that way. But you may be assured, it never entered my
heart to think of embarking without settling the minutest matter to
mutual satisfaction. But more of this when we meet. LORD, hasten our
glorious meeting in the kingdom of heaven.

              There sin and strife and sorrow cease,
              And all is calm and joy and peace.

I hope all is well in _Green-street_. Hearty love to all. All here send
greeting. A good time at _Mercer_’s chapel. Grace! grace! I know you
will join in saying _Amen_, with, my dear Sir,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                         _London, February 27, 1769._

_My dear Mr. S――――e_,

NOT want of love, but of leisure, hath prevented my making proper
acknowledgments for your kind letter, and late publication. I think it
is well written; and I earnestly pray, that it may be blessed to many.
One passage seems exceptionable, where you say, “That all believers
were originally endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Ghost.” The instances urged to prove it, seem quite deficient. This is
not written to find fault, but to prevent fault finding. That you may
be much owned in every thing you undertake, and, with all the Christian
_Sheerness_ brethren, increase with all the increase of GOD, is the
hearty prayer of,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Blessed be GOD, the shout of the King of kings is yet to be
heard amongst us. Grace! grace!

                           _To Mr. A――――s._

                                            _London, March 11, 1769._

_My very dear Tommy_,

YOUR consciousness of my settled friendship, will not permit you to
interpret my silence to a want of love. How great that is, and on
what a solid basis it is founded, the great day will discover. Through
infinite mercy, I am enabled to preach thrice a week, besides other
occasional exercises; and indeed (O amazing condescension!) the shout
of the King of kings is amongst us. After _Easter_, I hope to make
an elopement to _Gloucestershire_, and some western parts. Could you,
upon the receipt of this, go to _Bristol_? Mr. _B――――s_ must come
immediately to _London_. I feel the loss of my right hand daily; but
right hands and right eyes must be parted with for Him, who ordereth
all things well.

                I would believe thy promise, LORD;
                O help my unbelief!

Leaving you to add a heart-felt _Amen_, I am, my very dear _Tommy_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friends_,

I HOPE this will find you not only at, but fixed at _Bethesda_. Your
brother _James_ yesterday told me, “He thought it best.” It is not a
time to think of leaving a _happy wilderness now_. There’s more noise
in great cities. I am every day, every hour, almost every moment,
thinking of and preparing for _America_. A pilgrim life to me is
the sweetest on this side eternity. I am daily expecting _Bethesda_
accompts. I am daily waiting for the kingdom of GOD. GOD bless my poor
negroes. I am always, my dear friends,

                 Yours, &c. &c. in the Friend of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCVIII.

                                            _London, March 31, 1769._

_My very dear Tommy_,

YOU will be glad to hear, that frequent preaching hath prevented
writing. Through infinite mercy I have been enabled to preach four days
successively. And indeed we have been favoured with a blessed passover
season. All to make us shout louder and louder, Grace! grace! I have
some thoughts of making _Gloucestershire_ my first excursion: but at
present the cloud abides over _London_. LORD JESUS, direct my goings
in thy way! The books will be sent. Mr. _S――――e_ hath done as desired:
I believe he goes to _Bath_ next week. _B――――_’s coming was, I think,
of GOD. She seems happy in her present situation. In heaven we shall
be perfectly so. Till then, some right hand or eye must be cutting off,
and plucking out, and we shall feel the smart and want of both. But
all is well, because all will end well. _Hallelujah! Hallelujah!_ Come,
LORD, come! I can now no more. Adieu. GOD bless you all! Cease not to
pray, my very dear _Tommy_, for

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                     _To the Reverend Mr. S――――y._

                                             _London, April 1, 1769._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

HOW much am I obliged to you, for your two kind letters, and more
especially for the repeated offers of your ministerial assistance.
They will be most gratefully accepted, and I humbly hope remarkably
succeeded, by Him who hath promised to be with us always even to the
end of the world. Blessed be his name, we have been favoured with
delightful passover feasts. The shout of the King of kings is still
heard in the midst of our Methodist camps; and the shout of Grace,
grace! resounds from many quarters. Our almighty JESUS knows how to
build his temple in troublous times. His work prospers in the hands of
the elect Countess, who is now gone to _Bath_, much recovered from her
late indisposition. Worthy Lady _F――――y_ proposes soon to follow, in
order to reside there. Some more coronets, I hear, are likely to be
laid at the Redeemer’s feet. They glitter gloriously when set in, and
surrounded with a crown of thorns.

                Subjects of the LORD, be bold;
                JESUS will his kingdom hold:
                Wheels encircling wheels must run,
                Each in course to bring it on.

I know who joins in crying, _Hallelujah_! Even a _Waller_, a _Harriot_,
both heirs of the grace of life. That the Spirit of CHRIST and of
glory may abide and rest upon them here, and that they may shine with
distinguished lustre in his heavenly kingdom hereafter, most earnestly
prays,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER MCCCCX.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                              _Bath, April 18, 1769._

_My dear Friend_,

HITHERTO GOD hath helped us. A good opening at _Chippenham_. A precious
season here on _Sunday_ morning. This evening I am to preach again.
To-morrow, GOD willing, I shall set out for _Bristol_, and return
hither on _Saturday_ morning. I hope to write to Mr. _W――――r_, by
to-morrow’s or _Thursday_’s post. I thank him for his punctual sending
the papers. I find by them, who is dead, and by this time buried
in _Saint S――――n_’s chapel. The question is, whether there will be
a resurrection, or what will be the consequence? Whatever it be, this
is our consolation, “the LORD reigneth. Blessed be the GOD of our
salvation!” I hope this will find dear Mr. _E――――s_ proclaiming it with

cease to pray for,

_My dear Mr. W――――hy_,

I SUPPOSE you have heard, that all arrived safe at _Georgia_, _February
26_. The very moment they cast anchor, fifteen miles from _Savannah_,
an opportunity offered to send a few lines. This is the reason no other
letters are yet come. More may be expected daily. Be so good as to
send a line of information to _Essex_. I believe an opportunity will
soon present, to write by the ship bound for _Savannah_. My packet is
to come up early next week. We finish at _Bath_ next _Sunday_. About
a week more I stay in _Bristol_, or thereabouts. Good seasons every
where. What a mercy, that while the potsherds of the earth are dashing
each other in pieces, the great Head of the church is building up his
spiritual _Jerusalem_! That you and yours may be daily built up in the
most holy faith, earnestly prays,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear old Friend_,

THIS evening we are to have a love feast; yesterday had a good field
preaching at _Kingswood_. The night before I preached here. GOD willing,
to-morrow here again. _Sunday_ morning at _Bradford_. _Monday_ at
_Frome_. Then _Chippenham_, and other parts of _Gloucestershire_. I
designed to go to _Plymouth_, but I have such a cold, and the weather
begins to be so warm, that I know not how the issue will be. Hitherto,
blessed be GOD, we have had golden seasons. A letter may be sent by
_Saturday_’s post, to Mr. _B――――s_, at _Frome_. I hope all continues to
go on well. Brethren, pray for us! I sent some letters for _Georgia_,
to the care of Mr. _W――――hy_, but have heard nothing from him. I
wish you would write one line to my humble friend, and tell him he
is enquired after every where, and all are glad to hear of his safe
arrival. Grace! grace! That all may prosper both in soul and body,
earnestly prays, my dear old friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                                _Frome, May 8, 1769._

_My dear Friend_,

MANY thanks for your kind letter. A blessed day yesterday in _Bradford_
church. A blessed day here in the fields; thousands attended, all
more than solemn. Mrs. _M――――re_ I hope was touched at _Bath_ last
_Tuesday_ sevennight. Glorious prospect in these parts. Grace! grace!
I am now going to _Chippenham_, _Castlecomb_, _Dursley_, _Rodborough_,
_Painswick_, _Gloucester_, ♦_Cheltenham_, in my way to _London_. The
west circuit must be deferred, on account of the opening the chapel
at _Tunbridge_. I am easy about _London_, being so well supplied. GOD
bless you all! All send cordial respects. _W――――s_’s inadvertencies
grieve me. You will be punctual. I hope to answer Captain _J――――s_ in
a post or two. Love and thanks to Mr. _E――――s_. LORD prosper the gospel
plough! Adieu, I must away. Cease not to pray for, my dear Sir,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

_EBENEZER, Ebenezer!_ Through infinite mercy, I just now arrived
here. Blessed seasons at _Chippenham_, _Castlecomb_ and _Dursley_,
in our way from _Frome_. Have been enabled to preach five times this
week. It is good to go into the highways and hedges. Field-preaching,
field-preaching for ever! Cannot yet determine what course to steer
next. At present a very heavy cold lies upon me. JESUS’s warm love more
than makes amends for all. GOD fill all your dear souls with it! I am
easy, as you go on well in _London_. GOD bless you all. By _Saturday_’s
post you may know further concerning, my dear Captain,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, May 18, 1769._

_My very dear old Friend_,

ON _Monday_ evening we reached _Letchlade_, on _Tuesday_ _Maidenhead_,
on _Wednesday_ about noon, through infinite mercy, we got safe to town.
_Ebenezer, Ebenezer!_ My cold is about the same as when we parted. But
who knows what the Father of mercies may do for less than the least
of all his children, by next Lord’s-day morning? Perhaps we may be
favoured with another _Rodborough_ pentecost. Never was that place so
endeared to me, as at this last visit. Old friends, old gospel wine,
and the great Governor ordering to fill to the brim!

              _O to grace what mighty debtors!_ &c. &c.

I suppose you will sing that hymn soon; and if we should die in singing
it? What then? Why then, welcome, welcome eternity! GOD bless you
all! Yesterday I saw your sister _J――――s_ comforted under her trial. I
see, whether married or single, thorns in the flesh we must have. But
CHRIST’s grace will be sufficient for us. _Hallelujah! Hallelujah!_
Brethren, pray for us. Cordial respects to Mrs. _A――――s_; I think her
name is _Phebe_. I hope to send a few lines to Mrs. _R――――s_ and Mrs.
_H――――r_ very soon; in the mean while entreat them, and all like-minded,
to accept most grateful acknowledgments, and most cordial respects, and
be assured of being always remembered in the poor prayers of, my very
dear _Tommy_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, May 26, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

HOW did I send all over _Bath_, to enquire for you and yours! How have
I since prayed, that your present use of the baths may be blessed to
the recovery of your valuable health, and your soul sweetly refreshed
with drinking the waters of life freely! Both these things, I hope
you do and will experience fully. However it may be on earth, glory,
glory be to free grace! we are assured that we shall have a perfect
consummation of bliss, both in body and soul, in heaven. JESUS, thou
son of _David_! JESUS, thou Son of GOD! JESUS, thou GOD over all, GOD
blessed for evermore! give us patience to wait till this wished-for
time shall come! I suppose you have heard of my hoarseness, gotten,
through mercy, in the highways and hedges. A delightful spring campaign.
Many, I trust, were compelled to come in. Such news will gladden you,
because it gladdens the angels which are in heaven. With regret I must
shorten this. I shall send to know how you both do. GOD only knows, how
you are beloved and remembered by, my very dear friends,

                         Yours, &c. in JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCXVII.


                            _To the Same._

                                             _London, June 10, 1769._

_My very dear old Friend_,

HOW glad was I to find, that you could write so long a letter! Who
knows but the withered hand may be yet stretched out? “Abba, Father!”
all things are possible with thee! Grant it, if it be thy blessed will,
for JESUS CHRIST’s sake! This leaves me a little recovering from my
late indisposition, consequently it leaves me singing, “He will not
always be chiding, neither will he keep his anger for ever.” How truly,
how incomparably great, will these loving corrections make us in a
future state? Then shall we sing without sorrowing,

                O happy, happy rod,
                That brought us hither to our GOD!

In patience, therefore, may we possess our souls! Yet a little while,
and he that cometh will come, and will not tarry. GOD be praised, that
your dear nurse and yoke-fellow holds out so well. Mr. _M――――s_ tells
me she is brave. Mr. _D――――n_ dines with me, at his house, on _Friday_;
both will then be remembered. The covenant of grace was made from
eternity. _Hallelujah, Hallelujah!_ Come LORD, come!

                   Ever yours, &c. &c. in our JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, July 29, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

I THANK you for your intended benefaction. Our LORD will write himself
your debtor for it. His interest is pretty good, “a hundred fold.” A
hundred fold! what can the most avaricious trader desire more? It comes
very opportunely; for in looking over my _Georgia_ letters this morning,
I find Mr. _Dixon_ desires me to purchase negro cloth, and osnabrigs
for the negroes, in _London_; it will be a great saving, and render
double service to my dear orphan family. In about a month or five weeks
I hope to set sail. I long for your return, wish you could shorten your
_Scarborough_ expedition. I want to consult you in many things; and
in particular, to have proper writings drawn up, empowering you, as my
attorney, to act in all things as if I was present. O that you may have
the presence of our great Advocate, to guide, guard, and protect you
in journeying! May he be a wall of fire round about you, and be your
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and all in all! My hearty love
to Mr. _E――――ds_, Mr. _G――――th_, Mr. _A――――ge_, &c. &c. That the LORD
may richly reward you for all your disinterested labours of love, and
bless you and yours in time and eternity, is the constant prayer of, my
dear dear friend,

          Yours most affectionately in an unchangeable JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, July 30, 1769._

_My dear Sir_,

OLD friendship and love embolden me to send these few lines. Blessed
be GOD! the orphan-house affairs go on well, and a lasting ample
foundation is now laid, for the future support and education of both
rich and poor. Perhaps providence may call me to _Georgia_ this fall.
Could you present the infant institution with a book or two of maps,
or copies, or copper-plates, as you shall judge most proper? Sheet
maps will not do in that hot climate. I should also be glad of some
maps, shewing the different coastings, &c. for my own amusement when
on board. Glory be to GOD, all sublunary coastings will soon be over.
Yet a little while, and we shall get into an eternal harbour. JESUS
is the way, JESUS is our pilot. To his almighty never-failing guidance
and grace, I most earnestly commit you, and all your near and dear
connections, as being, my dear old friend,

              Yours, &c. &c. &c. &c. in our common LORD,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ If the motion is not approved of, silence shall serve for an
answer.

_My dear Captain_,

MY last to ――――, will make you guess that my hands and heart are full.
Last night I went on board the _Friendship_; the Captain is to dine
with me to-morrow. I expect to sail the first week in _September_ at
furthest. You must be then in town. Mr. _Brooksbanks_ (if Mr. _K――――n_
does not come) will supply your place. I hope all things will be
settled on a right plan. You may be assured of my having, under GOD,
the greatest confidence in you. I only wish some means may be found
out to save the late great expence of coach hire. It hath mounted very
high. But more of this when we meet. Blessed be GOD for smiling on your
labours. This is the way; you need not be exhorted to continue to walk
in it. GOD bless you! GOD bless you! Mr. _K――――n_ is expected from his
_Yorkshire_ tour on _Saturday_. All is well at home. Cordial love to
all. Brethren, pray for us. With regret I am obliged to hasten to
subscribe myself, my dear man,

         Yours, yours, &c. &c. &c. in our never-failing JESUS,

_My very dear Tommy_,

TALK not of taking a personal leave. You know my make. _Paul_ could
stand a whipping, but not a weeping farewel. My heart and hands are
full. What a letter-night last _Thursday_ evening! a night much to
be remembered. Many thanks for your intended present. In ten days I
expect to sail. GOD bless you and yours! GOD bless all our never to be
forgotten _Gloucestershire_ friends! I can no more. Adieu. Cease not to
pray for, my very dear steady old friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Man_,

BLESSED, for ever blessed be the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS
CHRIST, for causing his word so to run, and so to be glorified in your
hands. No wonder that you meet with a thorn in the flesh. But we know
who hath said, “My grace is sufficient for thee.” I have no objection
against your circuit westward. I believe it will be a blessing to
many souls. In a few days I expect to hear that either Mr. _D――――cy_
or _S――――y_ will be in town. If so, you may proceed; if not, I must
beg you to be here at the time of my departure. Ten days, and then.
What then? You may guess. GOD bless you and yours. GOD bless all dear,
christian, never-to-be-forgotten _Bristol_ friends. Last _Thursday_
evening was a parting letter-night indeed. A night much to be
remembered. Your flaming letter was read. That GOD may make you flame
more and more, till you are called to be a flaming seraph in yonder
heaven, earnestly prays, my very dear man,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Tommy_,

ALTHOUGH I could not write to you whilst ashore, yet I must drop you a
few lines now I am come aboard. Just now we have taken up the anchor:
and I trust my anchor is cast within the veil, where the ground will
never give way, otherwise, how should I have stood the shock of parting,
and put to sea at this time, or rather at this decline of life? But our
GOD can, and our GOD does renew both bodily and spiritual strength. I
have not been in better spirits for some years; and I am persuaded this
voyage will be for the Redeemer’s glory, and the welfare of precious
and immortal souls. I am assured I fare the better for the prayers of
my dear very dear _Gloucestershire_ friends. Our parting solemnities
have been exceedingly awful; and I thank GOD for giving me the honour
of taking my leave on _Sunday_ afternoon at _Gravesend_ market-place.
O for this rambling way of preaching till I die! If Mrs. _H――――ker_
gets into harbour before me, she will be well off. Cordial respects
await her, your wife, Mrs. _R――――ts_, and all the friends of _Zion_. O
_England! England!_ GOD preserve thee from and divert every threatening
storm! Follow, follow with your prayers, and assure yourselves of not
being forgotten by, my very dear friends,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                        _On board the Friendship, September 6, 1769._

_Dear Mrs. H――――ge_,

REPEATED labours of love demand repeated acknowledgments. GOD bless and
reward you and your daughter! I hope you both returned home laden with
the grapes of the _New-Jerusalem_. _Gravesend Bethels_, I trust, will
not easily be forgotten. I am sure you do not forget to pray for a very
worthless worm: a worm, and no man! And yet, (O amazing love!) JESUS,
a never-failing, ever-loving, altogether-lovely JESUS, careth for and
comforts him on every side. Hitherto it seems like my first voyage.
Grace! grace! What hath GOD wrought? With all thy mercies, glorious
_Emmanuel_, deny not the mercy of a thankful heart! Had I more humility,
I should be more thankful to GOD and man. But I once more bid you and
yours farewel. Salute all dear friends as they come in your way, and
tell them their prayers are and will be heard in behalf of, my dear Mrs.
_H――――e_,

                        _On board the Friendship, September 7, 1769._

_Dear Friends_,

ACCEPT a line of grateful acknowledgment for all favours. I know it
will find you busy: and busy, I believe, for the Redeemer’s glory.
You, therefore, shall and will prosper. This comforts me in my present
gospel enterprize. I am persuaded it is of, from, and for Him who loved
me, and gave himself for me, even ill and hell-deserving me. Glory be
to his great name, I am comforted on every side. Fine accommodations. A
civil Captain and passengers. All willing to attend on divine worship,
and to hear of religious things. Praise the LORD, O my soul! Faithful
mother _W――――d_, and all at Tabernacle, will be glad to hear of this.
Pray desire her to remember me in the kindest manner to Mr. _P――――ts_,
Mr. and Mrs. _T――――r_, Mr. and Mrs. _B――――s_, &c. &c. I remember
parting tears. JESUS hath bottled them up. Brethren, pray and give
thanks to Him, whose mercy endureth for ever. I am brave as to my
bodily health. Grace! grace! GOD bless you and yours, and all who are
so kind as to be concerned for, and enquire after, my dear old friends,

_Dear Mr. W――――hy_,

O THESE partings! Without a divine support they would be intolerable.
But with that, we can even do this and every thing besides, which we
are called to do or suffer. You will be glad to hear that every thing
turns out beyond expectation, as to bodily health, ship accommodation,
civility of passengers, &c. I only want somebody that hath a little
more brains about me: but we must have our _buts_ in this trying
imperfect state. Say what we will, without these things we could not
have our graces kept in exercise. GOD preserve you and all my religious
friends, amidst the exercises that I fear await them. Nothing less
than an almighty power can preserve and keep them in a proper temper.
Land-storms are often most dangerous. Tell all as they come in your way,
that their prayers are heard. I serve a GOD whose mercy endureth for
ever. Particular respects to Mr. _H――――s_, Mr. _B――――n_, Mr. _S――――s_,
Mr. _W――――e_, and all that accounted it their privilege to assist an
unworthy worm: not forgetting poor mother _E――――s_. You would all be
pleased to see how well I am. Grace! grace! O the privilege and honour
of leaving a little All, for a great unfailing All the ever-blessed
GOD! May you be kept unspotted, that are called to abide by the stuff.
You are surprizingly improved as to politeness of behaviour: may the
inward man be more than equally improved, and increase with all the
increase of GOD day by day! You will not fail to pray, that this may
be also the happy case of, my dear Mr. _W――――y_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                        _On board the Friendship, September 8, 1769._

THOUGH on the mighty waters, I must not forget faithful friends that I
have left behind. You, I am persuaded, are one of these. I have tried
you many years. GOD bless you and yours! GOD guide and keep you in your
new undertaking! You are launching into a wide sea. May JESUS be your
pilot! He will, he will. He is the widow’s husband, and will therefore
plead the widow’s cause. He is good to us on board. Praise Him, praise
Him whose mercy endureth for ever. Cease not to pray for, dear Mrs.
_M――――_,

                      Less than the least of all,

_My dear steady Friend_,

_EBENEZER! Ebenezer!_ Hitherto the LORD helps. All things are very
commodious on board, and hitherto I am comforted on every side. The
Captain and passengers are civil, willing to oblige, and ready to
attend on divine worship. We have had contrary winds in our way to
the _Downs_, but not violent. The young soldiers not yet sick, though
the ship hath some motion. I seem to be now, as I was thirty years
ago. Grace! grace! Praise the LORD, O my soul! The prayers of the dear
_Londoners_ are and will be heard. May the mercies bestowed upon us in
answer to their prayers, redound to thy glory, O my GOD! The care of
my annual pensioners, with all money matters, I must beg you to take
wholly into your hands. O how little can I do for Him, who hath done
and suffered so much for me! GOD be merciful to me a sinner! Tender
love to all. Cease not, cease not to pray forwards, and to pray back
again, my very dear Sir,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friends_,

AS we are now at our first baiting-place, and I have been thinking of
and praying for my tried, steady, uniform friends, no wonder that you
two came strongly upon my mind. Accept cordial thanks for all favours,
and add to my manifold obligations by praising Him, whose mercy
endureth for ever. He deals bountifully with us on board, and gives us
a prospect of being comfortable with all about us. You are called to
stay by, but blessed be GOD you are called to live above the stuff. A
pilgrim life is my lot. I am more than content with it. I shall have
time enough to rest in heaven. This heaven is begun on earth. You
know it, you know it. Ere long the budding flower will be full blown.
Afflictions, temptations, ordinances, providences, will all concur to
bring it to maturity. When this is done, death shall transplant it to
a better soil where it shall never fade, but increase in fragrance and
beauty through the endless ages of eternity. But I must not detain you.
This is your busy day. You have been gathering manna. A little hath
fallen round our floating camp. I know you wish us a trading voyage.
That you may sail into harbour with a very full and choice cargo of
heavenly wares, with your top-gallant sails flying, and shouting from
every quarter, Grace! grace! earnestly prays, my very dear friends,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Tell Mr. _K――――n_ I was in hopes of one line by _Saturday_’s
post. We had a violent gale yesterday. One ship we hear is gone.
Blessed be GOD we are all well.

                                          _Deal, September 14, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

IT hath really given me some concern, that notwithstanding I have
written so many letters, not a single friend hath wrote at a venture,
though if we had been sailed, the letter might have been returned. The
Captain hath been answered; _Winter_ hath been answered. But――all is
well. For wise reasons we are detained in the _Downs_. Who knows but it
may be to awaken some souls at _Deal_? A peculiar providence brought me
here. Warm-hearted Dr. _G――――ns_ came on board to pay me a visit, was
sick, lay in my state room, and learnt more experimentally to pray for
those who occupy their business in the great waters. Mr. _B――――y_ of
_Ramsgate_, and young Mr. _G――――ner_, who was ordained here yesterday,
followed after. At their request I came ashore yesterday morning. The
ordination was very solemn, and I have not been more affected under any
public ministrations a great while. At the request of many, I preached
in the evening to a crouded auditory, and spent the remainder of the
night in godly conversation. Dr. _G――――ns_ will acquaint you with some
pleasing particulars. If the wind continues contrary, perhaps I may
make an elopement to _Margate_. I wish I could see my sermon that is
printed. You may at a proper season, in a proper way, hint as from
yourself to ――――, that I have often thought he would do for _Bethesda_
academy. If I die, let not the hymn book be cashiered. I am glad to
hear of the _Amens_ at _Tottenham-Court_. I doubt not but it is the
same at ♦Tabernacle. I design to write to both, and to the conference,
&c. But I cannot enlarge now. The young sailors begin to be more handy,
and are attentive to oblige. This is the thirteenth time of my crossing
the _Atlantic Ocean_. GOD bless you all! If further detained, you will
hear again from, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

_P. S._ A parcel might be sent by _Saturday_’s coach, directed to the
care of ――――: he would return it if we are sailed. I should have the
papers and the sermon. The ship that was lost hath been taken up and
brought in. The passengers escaped in the boat. What are we that we
should be preserved? Grace! grace!

_My dear Mr. G――――d_,

I CANNOT forget your old readiness to serve and attend upon me. I
cannot forget your last parting conversation. Alas! alas! how little
do we know of the bitter cups that await us in the decline of life!
May JESUS sweeten them with his love! He will, he will. This will make
them palatable. This and this alone can make us cry from our inmost
souls, “The cup which my heavenly Father hath given me to drink, shall
I not drink it?” Though bitter, there is no death in this cup: on the
contrary, nothing but life, nothing but life. Courage then, my dear Mr.
_G――――d_, courage. Yet a little while and we shall see

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

Adieu. GOD bless you and yours. Hearty love to all that are so kind as
to enquire after and pray for me. Pray go to Dr. _G――――ns_, and tell
him I hope he got home well. I had a pleasant season at _Deal_ with
him and some other servants of our common LORD. What will heaven be? I
am lost in contemplation of it. And therefore must hasten to subscribe
♦myself, dear Mr. _G――――d_,

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR letter was quite refreshing. It found me on board. But Mr.
_B――――y_ came, put me under an arrest, and is carrying me away
to _Ramsgate_: I hope to arrest some poor run-away bankrupts for
the Captain of our salvation. You would be glad to be here. How
mysterious and yet how wise are his ways! Fain would I follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goes. Blessed be GOD that all is so well at _London_.
I trust all will be better and better. For CHRIST’s sake, let all
means be used to keep up and increase _Tottenham-Court_ and Tabernacle
societies. Pray be particular about church and state. A shaking season
awaits both. Happy they who have cast anchor within the veil. All send
due respects. Cordial love to your whole self, to all that sent their
love, and to all who are so kind as to enquire after, my very dear
steady friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

_My very dear steady Friend_,

I MUST not leave sight of the _Downs_, without sending you a few
grateful, sympathizing, parting lines. I know in what a situation they
will find you, filling up the measure of CHRIST’s sufferings which are
behind. Amazing! even bodily sufferings, when brought on by working for
Him, he accounts his own.

                He knows what this temptation means,
                For he hath felt the same.

What a mercy this, when wearisome nights and days are appointed for
us! O that patience may have its perfect work in our souls! It will,
it shall. Faithful is he that hath promised, who also will do it. Fine
sayings these for an old weather-beaten almost worn-out pilgrim, just
on his entrance upon a new voyage. But _Ebenezer! Ebenezer!_ He that
hath helped and delivered twelve times, will not fail the thirteenth.

                I would believe thy promise, LORD;
                O help my unbelief!

Hitherto the prospect is comfortable. Accommodations good. All on
board civil, and willing to attend upon divine worship. Above all,
JESUS is kind, yea very kind to the better part of, my very dear
never-to-be-forgotten friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

daughter and worthy son-in-law. Pray for us.

_My dear old Friend_,

I SYMPATHIZE with you from my inmost soul. What prickles have our
sweetest roses! How does GOD’s promise seemingly cross hands with his
providence! We would fain direct him: but his answer is, “I know it, my
son, I know it:” and hereafter we shall know it too. That _hereafter_
will soon come. It is coming every moment. Yet a little while, and we
shall see

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

I have no doubt, but this will be the happy lot of your dear
yoke-fellow. At present she walks in darkness, and sees no light. But
GOD will lighten her darkness, and the days of her mourning shall be
ended. Beg her to accept my most sincere and sympathetic salutations;
and assure yourselves, that neither of you are forgotten in the poor
prayers of, my dear friends,

                       Less than the least all,

_My very dear Friend_,

AS I have no parcel, I am ready almost to think somebody is coming.
I am just returned from _Ramsgate_, and going on board. Never did any
creature shew greater civility, heartiness, politeness, and generosity
than Mr. _B――――ry_. His friends were hearty too. Indeed and indeed I
believe solid good was done at _Ramsgate_. I preached on _Friday_ and
_Saturday_. It was hard parting this morning. I expect a long passage.
But all is well. I am kept comfortable. I could not go to _Margate_.
Friends that write, should direct where the letters are to be returned.
I am glad Mr. _S――――y_ is come. I shall write to _Bath_. Is my farewel
sermon printed? That is what I meant; no packet is come. Tender love to
all, to all. Never fear,

                Satan thwarts and men object,
                And yet the thing they thwart effect.
                                            Hallelujah!

_My dear Friend_,

I MUST not forget you and your dear yoke-fellow, whom I cannot but
number amongst my old first friends and children. I hope this will find
bodily pain subsided, or grace given to make it more than tolerable.
Little do we know what trials await the declines of life. But these
are like the finishing strokes of a limner’s hand before the picture
is sent for home. Yet a little while, and it shall be hung up in GOD’s
house above, as a trophy of the Redeemer’s blood and Spirit, to be
admired for ever and ever.

                        O heights of grace!
                        O depths of love!
                        LORD, fit us for
                        This house above!

is come. Though detained in the _Downs_, yet I hope we are sailing to

_Dearly beloved in the LORD_,

THOUGH absent in body, I am present with you in spirit. Not want of
love, but of leisure, prevented my holding a conference with you before
my embarkation. My hands and heart were full. Ere long, we shall go no
more out. In the mean while, may you all be pillars in the house of our
GOD! You are engaged in a good cause, and in a branch of the Redeemer’s
work, which hath, and I am persuaded will prosper more and more. What a
mercy, that fresh instruments are raised up, to preach to poor sinners
the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. I hope that the sound of his
blessed feet hath been heard behind young Mr. _D――――_; he seems to come
out in the first, old, itinerant methodistical way. No way like this.
Light and life must go together. Principles and power, principles and
power conjointly, alone can satisfy my dear tabernacle hearers souls.
Though dying, I should live, when I find that they and you stand fast
in the LORD, and go on, and are terrible like an army with banners.
This be your happy lot! Whatever becomes of ill and hell-deserving me,
may you increase with all the increase of GOD! Most cordial love awaits
Mr. _C――――_, Mr. _B――――_, Mr. _D――――_, Mr. _I――――_, or as many of them
as are in town. May all be helped, to give one and the same mighty
gospel all-powerful blast, till _Jericho_’s towering walls fall down
before them. Outward troubles, I am persuaded, await us. But in JESUS
we shall have peace. To his never-failing mercy I commend you and yours,
and all your near and dear connections. Brethren, pray for us; I know
you do. The Redeemer, in answer to your prayers, deals bountifully with
us. I am comforted on every side. Never less alone, than when alone
with my GOD. My anchor is cast within the veil. Though detained in the
Downs, I hope we are sailing towards our eternal haven. Still help us
forwards, and pray us back. Once more, GOD bless you all! GOD bless the
dear tabernacle society, bands and classes, and all that come to hear a
preached gospel under that despised yet highly honoured roof. I am sure
you will add, and GOD bless him, who from his inmost soul subscribes
himself,

_My very dear Captain_,

I WRITE a few lines at a venture, uncertain whether you are in town or
not. You see where they leave me; at our first baiting place. Had not
our Captain loitered at _London_ last Lord’s-day, we might have been
out of the channel. But then perhaps I might have lost the sale of some
gospel goods at _Gravesend_ market-place. I hope you, and all my dear
fellow labourers, will meet with thousands of moneyless customers, who
will come down to the price. Blessed news for bankrupts!

                Surely, O CHRIST, thy grace is free,
                For, O my GOD, it found out me!

He is good to us on board. All are civil and studious to oblige. I am
glad of the third cabin passenger. The steerage ones are old hearers,
and in distress. Who knows what a trading voyage we may have. When you
write to _Bristol_, pray tell Miss _B――――ne_ to acquaint Mr. _G――――n_,
that I am sorry I did not know who sent me the kind present in so
genteel a manner. He hath my grateful acknowledgments. The young
sailors have been a little sick. The Steward is very handy. I am
kept comfortable in soul and body. Pray on, my dear friends, pray
on. Remember our partings, our partings. Surely they will never be

_My dear old Friend_,

THOUGH my hands and heart were too full, to come and give you personal
thanks on shore, be pleased to accept my most grateful acknowledgments
for your kind present, and yet kinder letter, now I am on board. I know
your heart is formed for friendship, and therefore some kind of trials
of the affectionate kind, must make such impressions, as persons of
leaden souls and iron bodies, are utter strangers to. What a mercy,
that we have a compassionate High-Priest to apply to, who is most
sensibly touched with a feeling of our infirmities!

                He knows what sore temptations mean,
                For he hath felt the same.

Courage therefore, my dear Sir, courage. Yet a little while, and he
that cometh will come, and will not tarry. In the mean while, may both
of us be enabled to sing,

                O happy, happy rod,
                That brought us nearer to our GOD.

I write this out of the fulness of my heart. Old friendship more
than revives. GOD bless you, and all your near and dear connections!
Through infinite mercy, this leaves me comforted on every side. I want
a thousand tongues to praise Him whose mercy endureth for ever, and in
whom I am, my very dear Sir,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ I should be glad if you would be pleased to send the _Atlas_
to Mr. _K――――n_, woollen-draper, in the _Minories_. A ship goes soon to
_Georgia_.

                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                            _On board the Friendship, off New-Romney,
                                                 September 26, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

MAN appoints, but an all-wise, all-gracious GOD disappoints. Dear Mr.
_H――――y_ guessed right. This day sevennight we weighed anchor, and
sailed, though very slowly, as far as _Fair-Lee_. But for near five
days we have been tossed by violent gales, and last night, through
infinite mercy, cast anchor off _Dungenness_ and _New-Romney_. The new
sailors have been quite sick, but are now almost recovered. I have felt
very little, comparatively speaking, and have been able to read, &c.
&c. Had I known of having such a handy Steward, I might have spared
one hand; but what is, is best. In GOD’s due time, the winds will have
a commission to carry us on. Satan doth not like this voyage. Pray on,
pray on, my very dear friends, and never fear. All shall work together
for good to those who love GOD. I wish you had advertised against the
publisher of my last sermon. It is not _verbatim_ as I delivered it.
In some places, he makes me to speak false concord, and even nonsense.
In others, the sense and connection are destroyed, by the injudicious
disjointed paragraphs; and the whole is entirely unfit for the public
review¹. But we must suffer by the false zeal of professing friends,
as well as by the inveterate malice of public avowed enemies. If one
sentence is blessed to the conviction and edification of any single
individual, I care not what becomes of my character, though there is
no occasion of bringing ourselves into needless contempt. I write this
at a venture; we see a boat approaching, and hope it will reach us. We
have put back: O that it may quicken friends to pray us forwards. We
are like a man of war that hath been out on a short cruise, and then
returned into harbour. What awaits us we know not. It is not fit we
should. GOD bless you all, my dear, very dear friends. I remember your
times of meeting at both ends of the town. Sea is sea, land is land.
The GOD whom we serve, is GOD of both. To his never-failing mercy I
commend you. Continue to do the same for, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._


                                      _Off New-Romney, September 28._

STILL we are prisoners. But blessed be GOD, prisoners of hope! In GOD’s
due time, the word of command will be, _Go forward_. I am sadly off
for want of white biscuit. But GOD will supply every want. The boat
is going, that came off with some eatables. Adieu. Tender love to all.
Blessed be GOD, all is well! Cease not to pray for, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

    ¹ The very same censures are too justly applicable to the
      volume of sermons, now published by Mr. _Gurney_, as
      Mr. _Whitefield_’s.――――Relying on the accuracy of the
      shorthand-writer, and on the fidelity of the reverend
      gentleman who was to revise the sermons, and on their joint
      regard for the memory of Mr. _Whitefield_, his executors
      did agree to recommend the intended publication, and promote
      its sale; for which, a consideration was to be paid by Mr.
      _Gurney_, to be applied by them, according to the tenor of
      Mr. _Whitefield_’s Will. But on their receiving nine of the
      sermons, (worked off) to their great surprise, they found
      themselves, after perusal, unable to authenticate them,
      either as to language or sentiments; therefore judged them
      utterly unfit for publication, and told Mr. _Gurney_, that
      on no consideration whatever, could they recommend them to
      the public. The executors are extremely concerned on Mr.
      _Gurney_’s account, as well as for the character of their
      late worthy friend; and now wish that they had not rested
      with the hearing only _one half-sheet_ read to them, but
      had insisted on seeing the whole Manuscript, and every sheet
      from the press. However, though Mr. _Gurney_ ought to have
      stopped the press when first applied to, and although the
      agreement was never signed by either of the parties, the
      executors have repeatedly offered, that, besides chearfully
      renouncing all advantages, they will pay whatever expences
      Mr. _Gurney_ hath been at in the affair, and so take and
      burn the whole impression; as otherwise the purchasers must
      be deceived, and the name of the deceased sorely wounded.

_My dear Friend_,

WE have had a long, and in several respects a trying passage.
Particulars expect by the packet, which the pilot says will sail in two
or three days. This day week we first saw land; came over the bar the
28th instant, and should have been at _Charles-Town_ that evening, but
our ship was too light to obey the helm. We had the mortification of
seeing ten sailing in before us, and we ever since left in jeopardy.
Surely Satan foresees some signal good attending this voyage. In the
midst of all, blessed be GOD, we have had plenty of outward things;
and I am in better health than at the end of any voyage I have made for
some years. Mr. _Smith_ hath really behaved well, and been very handy
and attentive. The same may be said of Mr. _Winter_. We have been like
the three children in the fiery furnace. But the Son of GOD hath been,
and is (O amazing grace!) still with us. Please to remember us to all
concerned. Hoping soon to write from on shore, and most earnestly
praying, that grace, mercy and peace, may be multiplied upon you all,
I must hasten to subscribe my old but true name, “The chief of sinners,
less than the least of all saints,” but

                Your affectionate, obliged friend, and
                        willing servant to all,

                                                              _G. W._


                                          _Charles-Town, December 1._

BLESSED be GOD, a pilot-boat came yesterday along-side, and brought
us hither in safety to our unspeakable comfort in the evening. Our
reception as hearty or heartier than ever. Grace! grace! The ship is
not yet come up. Blessed be GOD, I am brave and well, and am to preach
this afternoon. Praise Him whose mercy endureth for ever! We have been
delivered out of great jeopardy. You will say so, when you receive
further particulars from, my dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                    _Charles-Town, South-Carolina, December 6, 1769._

_Dear Madam_,

SHALL I promise, and not perform? GOD forbid! You have one of my first
letters since our arrival. The long passage made shore more agreeable.
Miss _H――――y_ knows how to apply such an account. All we meet with here,
will be sweetly overruled to render heaven, and a sight of JESUS in the
heaven of heavens, more delightful. I am in hopes, by this last week’s
preaching, that some _South-Carolina_ souls are beginning to look
heavenwards. Grace! grace! In a day or two, GOD willing, we shall move
to _Bethesda_. Mr. _W――――t_ is come to meet me, and tells me all is in
great forwardness there. Ere long the top-stone of a building not made
with hands will be brought forth. How many of your beloved family will
join the shout, crying, Grace, grace unto it! Most cordial and due
respects attend them all. GOD be praised, heaven is in sight. JESUS is
our pilot: he will steer us safe over every bar; even over the last bar,
_Death_. Then will we sing,

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

O how good is it to bear the yoke in our youth! A glorious preparative
for a comfortable old age. That you and all your dear relatives, may
increase with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, dear
Madam,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                    _Charles-Town, December 9, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

IMMEDIATELY on our arrival, I sent you a letter by way of _Liverpool_,
and then promised you a particular and very explicit letter by this
packet: but it must be deferred a few days. So much company crowds in,
that together with my preaching every other day, &c. &c. I have scarce
the least leisure. Blessed be GOD, I have already met with some fruits
of my feeble labours in this place. An earnest, I hope, of good things
to come. To-morrow, I set off by water to _Georgia_, the roads being
almost impassable by land. Mr. _Wright_ is come to go with me, and
acquaints me that all is in great forwardness at _Bethesda_. How I am
directed in respect to that institution, you shall know hereafter. And
glory be to a never-failing GOD, an hereafter is drawing on apace, when
we shall sing,

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

I hope you and yours are helped to possess your souls in patience. GOD
bless and reward you! Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied upon you
and yours! All join in sending due and cordial respects. O give thanks
unto the LORD, for his mercy endureth for ever. Brethren, pray for us.
Tender love to all. Your letter to me by _Anderson_, I have not yet
received. Blessed be GOD, I am in health. Grace! grace! The packet is
about to be closed. Other ships are almost ready to sail. By one or all
expect to hear again from, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                       _Savannah, December 24, 1769._

_My very dear Friend_,

THE bearer _B―――― F――――_ is the steward of the ship in which I came
over: a very handy useful man; to whom in a great measure I owe the
chief comfort of my voyage, as to eatables. He hath had convictions
at times, and longs to live ashore. If you can serve him, do. I write
this at my old friends Mr. _Habersham_’s. I am to preach here this
morning, and to-morrow, and purpose in a few days to pay a visit to
_Charles-Town_. Blessed be GOD, all things are in a most promising way.
But I am obliged to leave Mr. _W――――t_ behind, for the work’s-sake.
Mr. _Smith_ goes with me. He is attentive, hath behaved well, and
been useful in the house. Never was I blessed with so many proper
industrious workmen and helpers before. Grace! grace! Next _Wednesday_
I am fifty-five years old. GOD be merciful to me a sinner, a sinner, a
sinner! As such, continue to pray, my dear steady friend, for,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Bethesda, January 11, 1770._

_Dear Sir_,

CAN I forget my dear, very dear old steady friend? rather let my right
hand forget her cunning. How are you? Still afflicted? still in pain?
still made to possess wearisome nights, and wearisome days? Well, all
will be over soon; soon, yea very soon shall we sing,

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

This prospect gives songs in the night; this makes _Georgia_ and
_Bethesda_ to more than smile: and indeed you and yours would smile too,
were you to see what a lasting foundation is laying for the support and
education of many yet unborn. All admire the work already done. In a
few months the top-stone, I trust, will be brought forth, with shouting,
Grace! grace! In the mean while I must range northward. I know who
will follow me with their prayers; even you and yours, whom I dearly
love, and whom I salute much in the LORD. GOD bless you all, for all
kindnesses conferred upon, my very dear friends,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

If I thought you did not, or would not use your globes, I would beg
them for our infant library. The increase of this colony is almost
incredible. Real good, I trust, is doing; and a blessed door is opening
for Mr. _W――――_’s usefulness. Blessed be GOD! Blessed be GOD!




                           LETTER MCCCCXLVI.


                           _To Mrs. H――――e._

                                        _Bethesda, January 11, 1770._

_Dear Mrs. H――――e_,

MY last to you left me just arrived at _Charles-Town_. This leaves me
an old inhabitant of, or rather a worthless sojourner at _Bethesda_.
Both, I hope, will find the worthy Mrs. _H――――e_ and her daughter
enjoying thriving souls in healthy bodies. Every thing here exceeds my
most sanguine expectations. I am almost tempted to say, “It is good for
us to be here.” But all must give way to gospel ranging: Divine employ!

                For this let men revile my name,
                I’d shun no cross, I’d fear no shame:
                All hail, reproach――――

I hope _London_ friends meet with enough of this. It is bad, more than
bad, when the offence of the cross ceaseth. This cannot be, till we
cease to be crucified to the world, and the world crucified to us: and
when that is the case, things are very bad. As Mrs. _H――――s_’s heart
and house are opened to so many ministers of a despised JESUS, she must
expect a double share. Not only reproach from the world, but judgings
and censures from the narrow-hearted bigotted part of the Church. But
she hath counted the cost; she knows in whom she hath believed, and who
will be her exceeding great reward. GOD will not have us take up with
any thing short of himself. Leaving you to cry, Grace! grace! with ten
thousand thanks for all unmerited favours, I must hasten to subscribe
myself

                 Your most obliged and ready servant,
                          in our common LORD,

                                   _Charles-Town, February 10, 1770._

_My dear Friend_,

LAST night a kind Providence brought me hither, where I received your
kind letter, dated _November 2d_. Blessed be GOD, that all things go on
so well at _London_! You reason well about ――――. I entirely agree with
you in sentiment concerning that matter. Through infinite mercy, this
leaves me enjoying a greater share of bodily health than I have known
for many years. I am now enabled to preach almost every day, and my
poor feeble labours seem not to be in vain in the LORD. Blessed be GOD,
all things are in great forwardness at _Bethesda_. I have conversed
with the G――――r in the most explicit manner, more than once, concerning
an act of assembly, for the establishment of the intended Orphan-house
College. He most readily consents. I have shewn him a draught, which
he much approves of; and all will be finished at my return from the
northward. In the mean while, the buildings will be carried on. As
two ministers from the _New-Jersies_, and _Rhode-Island_, have been
soliciting benefactions for their respective colleges, no applications
of that nature can be made here: but the LORD will provide! My eyes
wait upon Him, from whom all temporal and spiritual salvations come.
Since my being in _Charles-Town_, I have shewn the draught to some
persons of great eminence and influence. They highly approve of it, and
willingly consent to be some of the wardens: near twenty are to be of
_Georgia_, and about six of this place; one of _Philadelphia_, one of
_New-York_, one of _Boston_, three of _Edinburgh_, two of _Glasgow_,
and six of _London_. Those of _Georgia_ and _South-Carolina_, are to
be qualified; the others to be only honorary corresponding wardens.
I have therefore taken the freedom of nominating ******; and as _my
name_ is to be annihilated, they may accept the trust without expecting
much trouble, or suffering contempt for being connected with me. This,
I think, is the chief of the plan: more particulars that may occur,
together with the draught of the charter, you may expect hereafter. In
the mean while, cease not to pray for, my dear steady friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCCXLVIII.


                        _To Mr. R―――― K――――n._

                                   _Charles-Town, February 22, 1770._

_My very dear Friend_,

NO letters by the packet, or another ship that hath brought in above
five hundred from _London_! As I hear Captain _Rainier_ is bound for
_Savannah_, I hope at my return to _Bethesda_ to find a letter there.
Your last, dated _November 2_, was immediately answered. Mr. _B――――s_
will accept my most grateful acknowledgments for his kind present of
maps, charts, &c. In a few months, I hope, all will be compleated. But
what may these few months produce? LORD JESUS, prepare us for whatever
thou hast prepared for us, and give peace in our time, for thine
infinite mercy’s-sake! You must expect another draught soon. GOD be
praised for that saying, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
You would be pleased to see with what attention people hear the word
preached. I have been in _Charles-Town_ near a fortnight, am to preach
at a neighbouring country parish church next _Sunday_, and hope to see
_Georgia_ the week following. Perhaps I may sail from thence to the
northward, and perhaps embark from hence. LORD JESUS, direct my goings
in thy way! I am blessed with bodily health, and am enabled to go on
my way rejoicing. Grace! grace! Join in shouting those blessed words.
I wrote by one Captain _Watt_, who was to sail from _Georgia_ this
week. In that, you will find something concerning my late visit to,
and public entertainment at _Bethesda_. You see how often I pester
you with letters. I can only add, that you may tell all, I am happier
than words can express: which I take, in a great measure, to be owing
to the prayers of my dear _English_ friends, which are daily put up
for, and I hope daily returned by, an unworthy worm. Remember me most
affectionately to all, and expect to hear again very speedily from, my
very dear, dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCXLIX.


                           _To Mr. B――――n._

                                   _Charles-Town, February 27, 1770._

_My dear Mr. B――――n_,

I OWE you an answer to your kind letter. Blessed be GOD, I can send you
good news from a far country! All things at _Bethesda_ go on quite well.
My bodily health is upon the advance, and the word, I trust, runs and
is glorified. At present, my intended plan about returning continues
the same: but all depends on news from home. Strange! that none could
write a line or two by so many ships. Only one letter have I received
from Mr. _K――――n_ since my arrival. Next week, GOD willing, I return
to _Georgia_, and soon after I purpose to go to the northward. I know
who will follow me with their prayers: they will avail much. The LORD
JESUS be with all your spirits! I suppose you heard from _Bethesda_ by
Captain _Anderson_. Mr. _Wright_ is the main spring with regard to the
buildings, and all the other wheels move orderly and well. Praise the
LORD, O my soul! O this pilgrim way of life! To me it is life indeed.
No nestling, no nestling, my dear Mr. _B――――n_, on this side eternity.
This is not our rest. Ere long we shall sing,

                  All our sorrows left below,
                  And earth exchang’d for heav’n.

Leaving you to add _Hallelujah_, and sending most hearty greetings to
your whole self, and all enquiring friends, I must hasten to subscribe
myself, my dear Mr. _B――――n_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._


                                                           _March 4._

Pray tell Mr. _K――――n_, that I hope to write to him in a few days
from _Georgia_. To-morrow, GOD willing, I return thither. I trust
substantial good hath been done here. Grace! grace!




                            LETTER MCCCCL.


                           _To Mrs. H――――e._

                                       _Charles-Town, March 4, 1770._

_Dear Mrs. H――――e_,

ALTHOUGH at such a distance, I cannot forget Mrs. _H――――e_ and her
daughter, and all their works of faith and labours of love. I doubt not,
but this will find them on the full stretch for heaven, and as usual
abounding in the work of the LORD. It leaves me almost ready to return
to _Bethesda_, from a place where, I trust, the word hath run and been
glorified. Matters are now drawing near to a wished-for close. All
things have succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectation. I expect to
come according to the appointed time. But future things belong to Him
who orders all things well. Through mercy I enjoy more bodily health
than for many years last past. You will join in crying, Grace! grace!
Next month, I purpose moving to the northward. As Mr. _W――――t_ is the
main spring at the Orphan-house, I must leave him behind. Mr. _Smith_
is with me: he behaves well, and is diligent and attentive. You will be
so good as to remember me to all, as they come in your way. I hope my
good old Mrs. _Eades_, at _Tottenham-Court_, is well. That she and all
may ripen for heaven every day and every hour, is the earnest prayer of,
dear Mrs. _H――――e_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear worthy Friend_,

BLESSED be GOD, the good wine seemed to be kept till the last at
_Charles-Town_. Last _Thursday_ I returned, and found all well at
_Bethesda_. I am come to town to preach this morning, though somewhat
fatigued with being on the water three nights: upon the whole, however,
I am better in health than I have been for many years. Praise the LORD,
O my soul! I have been sadly disappointed in receiving no letters by
the _Charles-Town_ packet. All knew that I was to be in these parts,
only till the ensuing Lady-day: then I purpose to set off for the
northward. I drew at _Charles-Town_ for ――――_l._ perhaps may draw again
soon. Expect more particulars in a few days. This is waited for. GOD
bless you all! Dearly beloved in the LORD, pray for us. Time is scarce
allowed me to subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLII.

                                           _Bethesda, April 6, 1770._

_My very dear Sir_,

I AM waiting here for a brig that is to carry me northward, and for
a letter and news from _England_. Your last was dated, _November 2_:
several months have intervened. I now almost despair of hearing from
you again, till my arrival at _Boston_. But I hope that you and all
remember us more frequently than you write. You are daily remembered
at a throne of grace. How glad would many be to see our _Goshen_,
our _Bethel_, our _Bethesda_! Never did I enjoy such domestic peace,
comfort, and joy during my whole pilgrimage. It is unspeakable, it
is full of glory. Peace, peace unutterable attends our paths, and a
pleasing prospect of increasing, useful prosperity is continually
rising to our view. I have lately taken six poor children, and, GOD
willing, purpose to add greatly to their number. Dear Mr. _D――――n_ and
his wife are to sail the beginning of next month in the _Britannia_,
Captain _Dean_, bound for _Portsmouth_. We part with great respect.
Fain would I retain such an old tried disinterested friend in the
service of the sanctuary, and near my person. But what scheme to
pursue, I know not, being so uncertain as to the path which I shall
be called to take. A few months will determine: perhaps a few weeks.
More particulars expect by the _Britannia_. In the mean while, I can
only recommend you all to the blessed JESUS, and the word of his grace,
and entreat the continuance of your prayers in behalf of, my very dear
friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLIII.

                                          _Bethesda, April 16, 1770._

_My very dear worthy Friend_,

_HALLELUJAH!_ Praise the LORD! The books and letters both by _Ball_
and _Sunbury_, are come safe. You have done quite right. Our LORD must
choose his own means to bring about his own purpose. Mr. _Smith_ (the
clerk) was much rejoiced by receiving a letter. Poor Mr. _Jacob W――――t_,
an honest industrious creature, was as much dejected by receiving
none. If Mr. _G――――s_ had added a line or two to his present, it
would have been doubly acceptable. Next week, GOD willing, we sail for
_Philadelphia_. I shall leave letters behind me to come by Mr. _D――――n_.
All is well, all more than well here! Never, never did I enjoy such an
æra of domestic peace and happiness. I have taken in about ten orphans.
Prizes! prizes! _Hallelujah!_ Join, my very dear friends, join in
praising Him whose mercy endureth for ever. If possible, I shall write
a line to the _Welch_ brethren. They have sustained a loss indeed, in
the death of Mr. _Howell Davies_. GOD sanctify it! Surely my turn will
come by and by. But I must away to _Savannah_. Real good, I trust, is
doing there. The ship that brings this, is expected to sail to-morrow.
I have desired Mr. _W――――r_ to send you the particulars of our voyage.
All send due respects. GOD bless you! GOD reward you! Cease not to add
to my obligations, by continuing to pray for, my very dear worthy
friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Bethesda, April 20, 1770._

_My very dear Sir_,

TO my very great joy, a few days ago I received your kind letters
with all the papers. Give peace in our time, O LORD! We enjoy a
little heaven upon earth here. With regret I go northward, as far as
_Philadelphia_ at least, next _Monday_. Though I am persuaded, as the
house is now altered, I should be cooler here, during the summer’s
heat, than at any other place I know of, where I used to go. I should
be glad to treat you with some of the produce of our colony, which is
much earlier than yours. The audits, &c. sent with this, be pleased to
communicate to all my real friends. You have certainly determined quite
right in a late affair. Every thing concurs to shew me, that _Bethesda_
affairs must go on as yet in their old channel. A few months may open
strange scenes. O for a spirit of love and moderation on all sides, and
on both sides the water! I wish some books might be procured for our
infant library. But more of this in my next. Letters may now be sent
by way of _Boston_, _New York_, and _Philadelphia_. I should be glad
to hear often, if it be but a line. In all probability I shall not
return hither till _November_. Was ever any man blest with such a sett
of skilful, peaceful, laborious helpers! O _Bethesda_, my _Bethel_, my
_Peniel_! My happiness is inconceivable. A few hundreds, besides what
is already devoted, would finish all. I do not in the least doubt. I
have had nine or ten prizes lately. You know what I mean. Nine or ten
orphans have been lately taken in. _Hallelujah! hallelujah!_ Let Chapel,
Tabernacle, heaven, and earth, rebound with _Hallelujah_! I can no more.
My heart is too big to speak or add more, than my old name,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friends_,

LONG before now, I hope you have found, that I have not forgotten you
or your labours of love. This comes to inform you, that the Father of
mercies hath not forgotten to be gracious to the chief of sinners, and
less than the least of all saints. On the contrary, he daily loads us
with his benefits. _Bethesda_ is a place, that the LORD doth and will
bless. Dear Mr. _D――――n_ and his wife, will inform you of particulars.
Among other things, they will tell you of our new chapel. I have sent
for sundries for its use and completion. O help me to praise Him, whose
loving kindness is better than life! I hope your daughter grows in
grace, and will become like unto one of the polished corners of the
temple. That root and branch may increase with all the increase of GOD,
most earnestly prays, my very dear friends,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLVI.


                           _To Mrs. H――――e._

                                          _Bethesda, April 21, 1770._

_Dear Mrs. H――――e_,

NO such good news yet. Less than the least of all, is not drowned
to this very day. Perhaps he may live to see his _London_ friends in
_England_, or at _Bethesda_. How would many rejoice to be in such a
peaceful, commodious, and comfortable habitation! I cannot tell you
half. Blessed be GOD, I was never better, at this season of the year,
in bodily health; never more comfortable in my soul. Grace! grace!
_Hallelujah!_ Praise the LORD! Mr. _D――――n_, a faithful disinterested
friend, will acquaint you with particulars. He hath often heard me
speak of Mrs. _H――――e_ and her daughter _Phebe_. Still employed in the
old way. I am glad Mr. _D――――cy_ is under your roof. Put it all down
to the old account. GOD bless you all! I am sure you pray for me at
_London_. All join in sending cordial respects. Happy _Bethesda_! Help,
help in praising Him, whole mercy superaboundeth to, dear Mrs. _H――――e_,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLVII.

                                          _Bethesda, April 21, 1770._

_Dear Sir_,

ALTHOUGH I have scarce time to turn round, being just setting off
for _Philadelphia_, yet I must drop a few lines to my old invariable
friend. As I hear nothing to the contrary, I suppose he is yet in this
dying world. Well! so that we die daily to ourselves and the world, all
is well, and shall end well. This I am persuaded is your happy case.
In some degree, I trust, it is mine. Would you think it? My bodily
strength seems to be renewed, and every thing at _Bethesda_ is in a
most promising way. Dear Mr. _D――――n_, the bearer of this, must be
referred to for particulars. Never did I spend such a comfortable
domestic winter, as the last. Never was a man blessed with a better set
of skilful, peaceful, laborious helpers. All is of grace, with which,
that you, your dear yoke-fellow, and other connections, may be filled
brimful, is the hearty prayer of, my very dear Sir,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER MCCCCLVIII.


                           _To Mr. K――――n._

                     _Savannah, April 24, 1770, Five in the morning._

_My very dear Mr. K――――n_,

I AM just going into the boat, in order to embark for _Philadelphia_. I
hope the good wine was kept to the last, on _Sunday_. Mr. _D――――n_ and
his wife are to sail in about a fortnight. He is an honest creature,
and an excellent accomptant. I have written strongly in his behalf.
He will bring a large packet, and is to have ―――― pounds of you, which
I have given him as a present. I have also drawn on you for £. ――――;
perhaps shall draw no more for some time. This will prove a blessed
year for me at the day of judgment. _Hallelujah!_ Come LORD, come! Mr.
_Robert W――――t_ hath herewith sent you a power of attorney, begging you
would settle his affairs in _Essex_. He is worthy, for whom you should
do this. A quiet, ingenious, good creature, and his wife an excellent
mistress of the family. Such a set of helpers I never met with. They
will go on with the buildings, while I take my gospel range to the
northward. It is for thee, O JESUS, even for thee, thou never-failing
_Bethesda_’s GOD! But I can no more at present. Hoping to write again
soon from _Philadelphia_, and praying that all may increase with all
the increase of GOD, I must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear, dear
Sir,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLIX.

                                         _Philadelphia, May 9, 1770._

_My very dear Friend_,

THIS leaves me a two days inhabitant of _Philadelphia_. I embarked at
_Savannah_, in the _Georgia_ packet, on the 24th ultima and arrived
here the 6th instant. The evening following, I was enabled to preach
to a large auditory, and am to repeat the delightful task this evening.
Pulpits, hearts, and affections, seem to be as open and enlarged
towards me, as ever. Praise the LORD, O our souls! Whilst I am writing,
perhaps Mr. _D――――n_ and his wife are ready to sail from _Savannah_.
By them you will receive a large packet concerning _Bethesda_. All is
well, blessed be GOD, all is more than well there. As yet I have my old
plan in view, to travel in these northern parts all summer, and return
late in the fall to _Georgia_. All the letters and packets came safe.
I believe you had best write by the _New-York_ packet. But letters
directed either to _New-York_, _Boston_, or this place, will reach or
be sent to me. Through infinite mercy, I still continue in good health,
and more and more in love every day with a pilgrim life. GOD bless you,
and all my dear friends and hearers in the great metropolis. I know
they pray for me. They are never forgotten day or night. That all may
increase with all the increase of GOD, is the continual cry of, my very
dear steady friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Philadelphia, May 24, 1770._

_My very dear Friend_,

I WROTE to you by the last _New-York_ packet, as well as by Mr.
_D――――n_, who was to sail from _Savannah_ the 10th instant. I have now
been here near three weeks, and in about a week more I purpose to set
off for _New-York_ in my way to _Boston_. A wide and effectual door,
I trust, hath been opened in this city. People of all ranks flock as
much as ever. Impressions are made on many, and I trust they will abide.
To all the episcopal churches, as well as most of the other places
of worship, I have free access. My bodily health is preserved, and
notwithstanding I preach twice on the Lord’s-day, and three or four
times a week besides, yet I am rather better than I have been for many
years. This is the LORD’s doing. To this long-suffering, never-failing
LORD, be all the glory! Be pleased to excuse my enlarging. Whilst I am
itinerating, little leisure will be allowed for writing. The _New-York_
packet will be the best opportunity for you. The particulars herein
mentioned, be so good as to send by the first opportunity. I can no
more at this time. GOD willing, you will soon have another line from,
my very dear steady friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._

                                       _Philadelphia, June 14, 1770._

_My very dear steady Friend_,

THIS leaves me just returned from a hundred and fifty miles circuit, in
which, blessed be GOD! I have been enabled to preach every day. So many
new as well as old doors are open, and so many invitations sent from
various quarters, that I know not which way to turn myself. However,
at present I am bound to _New-York_, and so on further northward. Help
me to praise Him whose mercy endureth for ever. As yet I am enabled
to ride and travel chearfully; the heat not greater than yours in
_England_. Expect to hear further, as we go along. The ship I find is
going. Tender love to all. Cease not to stir up all to persevere in
praying for, my very dear friend,

                      Less than the least of all,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLXII.

                                           _New-York, June 30, 1770._

_My very dear Friend_,

I HAVE been here just a week. Have been enabled to preach four times,
and am to repeat the delightful task this evening. Congregations are
rather larger than ever. You will see by the inclosed packet, what
numerous invitations from every quarter I am daily receiving. Blessed
be GOD, I have been strengthened to itinerate and preach daily for some
time. Next week I purpose to go to _Albany_. From thence, perhaps, to
the _Onoida Indians_. There is to be a very large _Indian_ congress;
Mr. _Kirkland_ accompanies me. He is a truly christian minister, and
missionary. Every thing possible should be done to strengthen his hands
and his heart. I shall write, GOD willing, at my return. The letters
dated _February 22_, with the packet of papers, I have received here
from _Charles-Town_. The _New-York_ packet is the surest conveyance.
Perhaps I may not see _Georgia_ till _Christmas_. As yet, I keep to my
intended plan, in respect to my returning. LORD JESUS, direct my goings
in thy way! The heat begins now to be a little intense; but through

_My very dear Friend_,

SINCE my last, and during this month, I have been above a five hundred
miles circuit, and have been enabled to preach and travel through the
heat every day. The congregations have been very large, attentive, and
affected, particularly at _Albany_, _Schenecdady_, _Great Barrington_,
_Norfolk_, _Salisbury_, _Sharon_, _Smithfield_, _Powkeepsy_, _Fishkill_,
_New Rumburt_, _New Windsor_, and _Peckshill_. Last night I returned
hither, and hope to set out for _Boston_ in two or three days. O what a
new scene of usefulness is opening in various parts of this new world!
All fresh work, where I have been. The divine influence hath been as
at the first. Invitations croud upon me both from ministers and people,
from many, many quarters. A very peculiar providence led me lately to a
place, where a horse-stealer was executed. Thousands attended. The poor
criminal had sent me several letters, hearing I was in the country.
The Sheriff allowed him to come and hear a sermon under an adjacent
tree. Solemn, solemn! After being by himself about an hour, I walked
half a mile with him to the gallows. His heart had been softened
before my first visit. He seemed full of solid divine consolations.
An instructive walk. I went up with him into the cart. He gave a short
exhortation. I then stood upon the coffin, added, I trust, a word in
season, prayed, gave the blessing, and took my leave. Effectual good,
I hope, was done to the hearers and spectators. Grace! grace! But I
must not enlarge. The Ship is going, and I keep at home to write this.
O that you had only dropped a line by the _New-York_ packet! That is
convenient for all parts of the continent. My next may be from _Boston_.
Pray excuse me to all; for travelling and preaching entirely prevent my
writing as I would. All are continually remembered by, my very dear
friend,

                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER MCCCCLXIV.


                           _To Mr. W――――t._

                                        _Boston, September 17, 1770._

_Dear Mr. W――――t_,

I AM afraid, as Mr. _E――――n_ mentioned your writing, that your letter
hath miscarried. But, blessed be GOD! I find all was well; only I
want to know what things are wanted, that I might order them from
_Philadelphia_, by Captain _Souder_. Fain would I contrive to come by
him, but people are so importunate for my stay in these parts, that I
fear it will be impracticable. LORD JESUS, direct my goings in thy way!
He will, he will! My GOD will supply all my wants, according to the
riches of his grace in CHRIST JESUS. By a letter, received last night
from Mr. _W――――y_, of _July 5_, I find that Mr. _D――――n_ was arrived,
_Anderson_ sailed, and that all orders would be immediately complied
with. Two or three evenings ago, I was taken in the night with a
violent lax, attended with reaching and shivering, so that I was
obliged to return from _Newbury_, &c. &c.; but, through infinite mercy,
I am restored, and to-morrow morning hope to begin to begin again.
Never was the word received with greater eagerness than now. All
opposition seems as it were for a while to cease. I find GOD’s time is
the best. The season is critical as to outward circumstances. But when
forts are given up, the LORD JESUS can appoint salvation for walls and
for bulwarks; he hath promised to be a wall of fire round about his
people. This comforts me concerning _Bethesda_, though we should have a
_Spanish_ war. You will be pleased to hear I never was carried through
the summer’s heat so well; I hope it hath been so with you, and all my
family. Hoping, ere long, to see you, I must hasten to subscribe myself,
my dear Mr. _W――――t_,

                          Yours, &c. &c. &c.

                                                              _G. W._

                     _Portsmouth, New Hampshire, September 23, 1770._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR letters, of _May 2_ and _22_, came to hand. _New-York_ packet
is always the surest and most centrical medium of conveyance. Before
I left _Boston_, on _Friday_ afternoon, I left a large packet in the
hands of a young man, who promised to deliver it to you safely. You
and Mr. _H――――y_ may peruse all, and communicate what you think proper.
By this time I thought to be moving southward. But never was greater
importunity used to detain me longer in these northern parts. Poor
_New-England_ is much to be pitied; _Boston_ people most of all. How
falsely misrepresented! What a mercy, that our _christian charter_
cannot be dissolved! Blessed be GOD for an unchangeable JESUS! You will
see, by the many invitations, what a door is opened for preaching his
everlasting gospel. I was so ill on _Friday_, that I could not preach,
though thousands were waiting to hear. Well, the day of release will
shortly come,¹ but it does not seem yet; for, by riding sixty miles,
I am better, and hope to preach here to-morrow. I trust, my blessed
Master will accept of these poor efforts to serve him. O for a warm
heart; O to stand fast in the faith, to quit ourselves like men, and
be strong! May this be the happy experience of you and yours! I suppose
letters are gone for me, in _Anderson_, to _Georgia_. If spared so long,
I expect to see it about _Christmas_. Still pray and praise. I am so
poorly, and so engaged when able to preach, that this must apologize
for not writing to more friends. It is quite impracticable. Hoping to
see all dear friends about the time proposed, and earnestly desiring
a continued interest in all your prayers, I must hasten to subscribe
myself, my dear, very dear Sir,

    assiduously in that place,¹ and the neighbouring settlements,
    till _August 28_ following, and then went to _South Carolina_,
    and embarked on board the _Mary_, Captain _Cae_, for _England_,
    that he might receive priest’s orders, for his further service
    to that people, and raise contributions for erecting an
    Orphan-house in the new colony at _Georgia_, which he saw was
    greatly wanted.

_My good Friends_,

AS GOD has been pleased to place you more especially under my care;
so whether absent or present, I think it my duty to contribute my
utmost endeavours towards promoting the salvation of your precious and
immortal souls. For this end, and this only, GOD is my judge, came I
amongst you; for this end am I now parted from you for a season; and
for this end do I send you this general epistle. I love, I pray for,
therefore do I write to you all without exception. But what shall I
write to you about? Why, of our common salvation, of that one thing
needful, of that new birth in CHRIST JESUS, that ineffable change which
must pass upon our hearts, before we can see GOD, and of which you have
heard me discourse so often. Let this, this, my dear friends, be the
end of all your actions. Have this continually in view, and you will
never do amiss. The author of this blessed change, is the Holy Ghost,
the third person in the ever-blessed Trinity. The Father made, the Son
redeemed, and the Holy Spirit is to sanctify, and so apply CHRIST’s
redemption to our hearts. The means to attain this Holy Spirit, you
know, and the way you know; _Self-denial_, and the _way of the Cross_.
“If any man will come after me (says JESUS CHRIST) let him deny himself,
and, take up his cross daily, and follow me.” And, I cannot but think
it a particular blessing, which you enjoy above others; because you
are in a new colony, where daily crosses must necessarily fall in your
way. O then, I beseech you by the mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, make
a virtue of necessity, and take up your daily crosses with resignation
and thanksgiving. Another means to attain the Holy Spirit, is _public
worship_: for CHRIST has promised, “where two or three are gathered
together in his name, there will he, by his Spirit, be in the midst
of them.” For your zeal in this particular, I have often blessed GOD
within myself, and made mention of it to others. O continue like-minded,
and as in my presence, so in my absence, do not forsake the assembling
yourselves together in the house of GOD; for there you will have the
scriptures read, though not expounded; and the Holy Spirit, if you
apply to him, will open your understandings, and guide you into all
truth. Many other means there are of attaining the Holy Ghost, such
as, _reading the scriptures,――secret prayer,――self-examination_, and
_receiving the blessed Sacrament_;――all which I would insist on, could
they be comprised in a letter. But this must be deferred till I see you
in person, and am qualified to administer unto you the sacred symbols
of CHRIST’s blessed body and blood. In the mean while, think not that
I shall forget you in my prayers; no, I remember my promise, and whilst
the winds and storms are blowing over me, I make supplication to GOD in
your behalf. Though absent in body, I am present in spirit, and joy in
hopes of hearing of your zeal for the LORD. Remember, my dear friends,
that for the space of near four months, I ceased not, day and night,
warning every one of you to repent and turn to GOD, and bring forth
fruits meet for repentance. Repent you therefore, and walk in all
things as becometh the gospel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and then, and
then only, shall your sins be blotted out. Finally, my brethren, be all
of one mind. Let there be no divisions among you; for a kingdom divided
against itself cannot stand. Be over careful for nothing, but in every
thing, with supplications and thanksgiving make your wants known unto
GOD. Speak not evil one of another, brethren, but live at peace among
yourselves; and the GOD of peace shall in all things direct and rule
your hearts. Brethren, pray for us, that GOD would prosper the works of
his hands upon me, and restore me to you as soon as possible. In about
eight months, GOD willing, I hope to see you; in the mean while, you
shall not be forgotten by

              Your affectionate, though unworthy minister
                           in CHRIST JESUS,

                                                              _G. W._


                   _To the Inhabitants of Savannah._

                                          _London, January 19, 1739._

_My dear Friends_,

THOUGH a woman may as soon forget her sucking child, yet, I fear,
you have before this time thought, that I have forgotten you. But GOD
forbid! As I have told you often, so I tell you again; You are upon my
heart, so that I am ready to live and die with you; and, GOD willing,
as soon as my affairs are finished in _England_, I shall return to
you again. The Trustees have now appointed me minister of _Savannah_,
and granted all I desired of them, so that I have nothing to do, but
to watch over your souls, that I may present you blameless at the
coming of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. Be stedfast therefore, my brethren,
be unmoveable. Carefully attend to the words spoken by your present
Pastor, and strive to enter in at the strait gate. Let love be without
dissimulation. Let not slander so much as be named amongst you, as
becometh saints. Be not slothful in business; yet take heed that you
are fervent in spirit, serving the LORD. Pray without ceasing. In every
thing give thanks; and assure yourselves, you are continually
remembered by

                    Your most affectionate Pastor,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ My business in _England_ detaining me longer than I expected,
I have therefore written this to assure you, that I will return as soon
as possible.¹

                                  AN
                      ACCOUNT of the ORPHAN-HOUSE
                              in GEORGIA.


                               PREFACE.

BEING now about to embark for _Georgia_, I am willing, before I go,
to give the world a short account of the Orphan-House erected there. I
have, therefore, in the following sheets, reprinted a continuation of
an account published when I was last at _Edinburgh_; to which I have
subjoined some letters received since; and also an account of money
received and disbursed since the publication of that account: and in
order to give the reader a view of this design from its beginning,
I have affixed my preface to the account I first published about two
years ago. I commend it to GOD. May he give it his blessing!

                                                              _G. W._

_London, January 14, 1743._


                                       _Bethesda, December 23, 1741._

THE following sheets, to the best of my knowledge, contain a faithful
account of what money I have received, as also how I have disbursed it,
for the use of the Orphan-House in _Georgia_.

I think, with a full assurance of faith I may affirm, the LORD put it
into my heart to build that house. It has prospered beyond expectation.
It has already, and I hope will more and more answer its name,
_Bethesda_, and be a House of Mercy to the souls and bodies of many
people, both old and young.

When I left _England_, I proposed to take in only twenty children;
but when I arrived at _Georgia_, I found so many objects of charity,
besides the orphans, among poor people’s children, that I resolved in
this, as well as in all other respects, to imitate Professor _Franck_,
and make a provision for _their_ maintenance also.

Two of the orphan boys were put out apprentices just before I last left
_Savannah_; one to a bricklayer, the other was bound to a carpenter;
a third is to be bound to the surgeon belonging to the Orphan-House;
one weaves in a loom at home; two I have put to a taylor I brought
over, and the rest are now fitting themselves to be useful to the
commonwealth. Whoever among them appear to be sanctified, and have a
good natural capacity, these, under GOD, I intend for the ministry.

None of the girls are put out as yet, but are taught such things as
may make them serviceable whenever they go abroad. Two or three of them
spin very well. Some of them knit, wash, clean the house, get up the
linen, and are taught house-wifery. All that are capable, are taught to
sew. And the little girls, as well as the boys, are employed in picking
cotton. I think I have no less than three hundred and eighty-two yards
of cloth already in the house, and as much yarn spun as will make near
the same quantity; a thing not known before in _Georgia_.

I have now forty-nine children under my care, twenty-three _English_,
ten _Scots_, four _Dutch_, five _French_, seven _Americans_. Twenty-two
of these are fatherless and motherless, sixteen of them boys, and
six girls. The others are some fatherless, and some without mothers;
all objects of charity except three, whose friends recompense the
Orphan-House for their maintenance. One of the orphans is an infant;
I pay four shillings _per_ week for nursing it. Since _December_ last,
we have had above eighteen more children that have been maintained
occasionally, to assist their parents, but were dismissed when they
were wanted at home.

The account which I find Mr. _Seward_ has given of our œconomy, has in
a great measure prevented my doing it as I intended. Let it suffice to
inform our benefactors, that though the children are taught to labour
for the meat which perisheth, yet they are continually reminded to seek
_first_ the kingdom of GOD and his righteousness, and then to depend
upon GOD’s blessing on their honest endeavours, for having food and
raiment added unto them. This precept of our LORD, I intend, when the
house is finished, to have written over against the entrance in at the
great door.

As my design in founding the Orphan-House was to build up souls for GOD,
I endeavour to preach chiefly to the children’s hearts. But that they
may be able to give a reason of the hope that is in them, I constantly
instruct them by the Church of _England_’s Articles, which I turn into
catechetical questions. I am often pleased to hear how judiciously
some will answer the questions put to them. The power of GOD has been
frequently visible among the children. Many of the girls seem to be
tender-hearted; several of the boys have been under strong convictions.
And though it sometimes seems buried, yet I cannot but think the seed
of grace is sown in some of their hearts.

We are now all removed to _Bethesda_. We live in the out-houses at
present; but in less than two months, the great house will be finished
so as to receive the whole family.

It is now weather-boarded and shingled, and a piazza of ten feet wide
built all around it: which will be wonderfully convenient in the heat
of summer. One part of the house would have been entirely finished,
had not the _Spaniards_ lately taken from us a schooner loaded with ten
thousands bricks, and a great deal of provision, with one of our family.
And therefore, I could not till very lately procure another boat to
fetch brick from _Charles-Town_.

Notwithstanding this, and many other hindrances, the work has been
carried on with great success and speed. There are no less than four
framed houses, a large stable and cart-house, beside the great house.
In that there will be sixteen commodious rooms, besides a large cellar
of sixty feet long and forty wide. Near twenty acres of land are
cleared round about it, and a large road is made from _Savannah_ to
the Orphan-house, twelve miles in length: a thing, ever since the
province has been settled, without a precedent.

None but those upon the spot can tell the expence, as well as
inconvenience that attends building in _Georgia_. Most of the bricks
already used, cost 40s. sterling _per_ thousand, when landed at the
plantation. Common labourers, besides their provisions, have 25s.
sterling a month. And, after all, ♦the produce of the land cultivated
by white servants, will scarcely furnish them with ordinary food and
raiment, exclusive of the expences of sickness and wages. I cannot see
how it is possible for the Colony to subsist on its present footing.
And in a late memorial given in to the Honourable Trustees, unknown to
me, the people have declared, that if it were not for the money that
has been expended on account of the Orphan-house, the poor inhabitants
of the northern parts of the colony must have been obliged to move
to some other place. Never did a country stand more in need of a
charity-school.

    ♦ removed duplicate word “the”

We have often been in some difficulties, but the LORD as often hath
relieved us out of them. When the schooner was lost, a person lately
converted, sent us eleven barrels of rice, and five barrels of beef.
And in my absence, when my family had little or no provisions, the
_Indians_ brought in plenty of deer, till they were supplied with food
some other way. The contributions in _Charles-Town_, _New-England_,
_New-York_, and _Pensilvania_, I think have been extraordinary.

The infirmary, which has likewise been supported by this institution,
has been of great service. The surgeon informs me, that if every one
had been forced to pay for their nursing and medicines, it would have
cost them two hundred pounds, sterling. I have now three or four sick:
I keep a woman to attend them constantly.

GOD has much blessed our family with health. Only two have died out of
so large a number, since my arrival; and these were two that came with
me from _England_: a taylor, and one of the women: I believe they are
now with GOD.

I have left behind me, as my assistants, (who have no other gratuity
than food and raiment) two school-masters and their wives who are
school-mistresses. One young man, who is also married to a young
maiden, lately brought home to GOD, I have left at the Orphan-house, as
superintendent, and chief manager of the outward things. There are also
the surgeon and his wife, a shoemaker and spinstress; besides labourers
and monthly hired servants: I think, in all, I have upwards of eighty.
The LORD, I am persuaded, is able and willing to provide for them.

I think we have near two hundred hogs, and one hundred head of cattle.
I give a man forty pounds sterling, _per annum_, to take care of them;
he providing himself with provision, horses, and a servant. As yet
we have had no advantage from our stock, it being a very dry season
last summer; so that our cattle of all kinds have scarcely food to
eat. But in a year or two, we hope, by the divine blessing, to have a
considerable quantity of fresh provisions for our family.

As for manuring more land than the hired servants and great boys can
manage, it is impracticable without a few negroes. It will in no wise
answer the expence.

I am now upwards of eight hundred pounds in debt, on the Orphan-house
account. Some particular friends have been pleased to assist me. I
doubt not but our LORD will enable me to pay them, and also raise up
fresh supplies for the maintenance of my large family.

I much rejoice in the institution: it has been very beneficial, not
only to the bodies, but also to the souls of the labourers. One woman
received CHRIST very lately at _Bethesda_: and I have great reason to
believe, that three or four strangers, who came to see us, have been
effectually brought home to GOD.

Great calumnies have been spread abroad concerning our management of
the children: people shoot out their bitter arrows in _America_, as
well as in _England_. One poor man was filled with such resentment, at
the reports he had heard of our cruelty to the children, that he came
on purpose from _South-Carolina_, to take away his two boys, whom out
of compassion, I had taken into the Orphan-House: but, when he came and
saw the manner in which they were educated, he was so far from taking
his children away, that he desired to come and live at the Orphan-house
himself.

I speak not this by way of boasting, or to wipe off reproach; for I
know, let me do what I will, I shall never please some men. I thought
proper to give this short account, for the satisfaction of those who
have already contributed, and of others who may be stirred up by our
good GOD, to contribute hereafter towards carrying on this good design.

                   *       *       *       *       *

That the children may learn to be grateful, they frequently sing the
following hymn for their benefactors:

                                I.
              Father of Mercies, hear our prayers,
                For those that do us good;
              Whose love for us a place prepares,
                And gives the orphans food.

                                II.
              Their mites, in blessings on their heads,
                A thousand fold restore;
              O feed their souls with living bread,
                And let their cup run o’er.

                                III.
              Thy bounty, LORD, in CHRIST built up,
                Let them for ever prove:
              Stedfast in faith, joyful thro’ hope,
                And rooted deep in love.

                                IV.
              For those, who kindly this support,
                A better house prepare:
              And when remov’d to thy bless’d courts,
                O let us meet them there.

That they may always look to the rock from whence they are hewn, they
sing daily this hymn.

                                I.
                Come let us join our GOD to bless,
                  And praise him evermore;
                That Father of the fatherless,
                  That helper of the poor.

                                II.
                Our dying parents us forsake,
                  His mercy takes us up,
                Kindly vouchsafes his own to make,
                  And he becomes our hope.

                                III.
                For us, He, in the wilderness,
                  A table has prepar’d;
                Us, whom his love delights to bless,
                  His providence to guard.

                                IV.
                Known unto him are all our wants,
                  And when we seek his face,
                His open hand our bodies feeds,
                  He feeds our souls with grace.

                                V.
                Then let us in his service spend,
                  What we from Him receive;
                And back to Him what he shall lend,
                  In thanks and praises give.

That they may learn to labour truly to get their own living, they sing
as follows, before they go to work,

                                I.
              Let us go forth, ’tis GOD’s command;
                Let us make haste away,
              Offer to CHRIST our hearts and hands,
                We work for CHRIST to-day.

                                II.
              When he vouchsafes our hands to use,
                It makes our labour sweet.
              If any now to work refuse,
                Let not that sluggard eat.

                                III.
              Who would not do what GOD ordains,
                And promises to bless?
              Who would not ’scape the toils and pains
                Of sinful idleness?

                                IV.
              In vain to CHRIST the slothful pray;
                We have not learn’d him so.
              No: for he calls himself the way,
                And work’d himself below.

                                V.
              Then let us in his footsteps tread,
                And gladly act our part;
              On earth employ our hands and head,
                But fix on heaven our heart.

The following hymn was composed to be sung at the admission of a new
child or children.

                                I.
                Welcome, dear brethren, whom we love;
                  |Bethesda| this we call.
                A house of mercy may it prove
                  To you, to us, to all!

                                II.
                What tho’ our parents dear are dead,
                  Yet our great GOD provides.
                Our bodies here are cloth’d and fed;
                  Our souls have christian guides.

                                III.
                The heavenly manna, day by day,
                  They freely do impart;
                Let us not trifle time away!
                  But lay it in our heart.

                                IV.
                O let the love of CHRIST constrain!
                  Why should we need a rod?
                Few e’er such blessed means obtain
                  Of leading them to GOD.

Besides these hymns, they generally sing a grace before and after meat,
and are taught so to vary their exercises, that they may not be cloyed
by a too frequent repetition of the same things on the one hand, and
yet are kept in such a general method, that they may not learn to be
desultory and fickle on the other.

GOD only knows the concern that lies upon me on account of this family,
not only in respect to their bodily, but their spiritual provision.
And therefore I hope all that wish well to _Zion_, will help me with
prayers, as well as their alms, that it may grow up a holy temple
to the LORD, and be blessed; that it may rightly be stiled _Pietas
Georgiensis_, and like the _Pietas Hallensis_, or Professor _Franck_’s
Orphan-House at _Glaucha_, near _Hall_, become the joy of the whole
earth. Even so, LORD JESUS, _Amen_, and _Amen_.

                                                              _G. W._




                                   A
                    CONTINUATION OF THE ACCOUNT OF
                     THE ORPHAN-HOUSE IN GEORGIA.


                                     _Edinburgh, September 14, 1742._

EVER since the LORD has been pleased to put me into the ministry, it
has been my constant prayer to GOD, that I might _provide things honest
in the sight of all men_. Not one part of my outward conduct, as I know
of, hath passed unobserved and uncensured by some wicked unreasonable
men: but what seems to have given the greatest offence, and caused
the loudest outcry, has been my making public collections for an
Orphan-House in _Georgia_.

Some indeed affirm that there is no such thing. But how it could enter
into the heart of any to say so, I should not have conceived, unless
the scripture had said, _the heart of man is desperately wicked_.

Somewhat more than a twelve-month ago, I printed an account of the
situation and oeconomy of the Orphan-House, and what I was in arrears
when I left _Georgia_, _January 1741_. My chief design now, is, to
give a short account of the progress of the work since, both as to our
temporal and spiritual concerns, so far as lies in my power.

The salvation of souls is the chief thing I had in view, when GOD put
it into my heart to build this house. I would then begin with that
first.

And here I would pause a while, and acknowledge that I am much indebted
to the divine goodness, for what he has already done for many souls,
since its first institution. I must confess, to the glory of GOD, it
has far exceeded my expectations.

During the time I was among them, before my going to, and after
my return from, _Philadelphia_, _Boston_, &c. there were several
remarkable awakenings amongst the children, and others, belonging to
the house, much resembling the blessed awakening now at _Cambuslang_,
and other places in these kingdoms; as will appear from consulting
some of my latest Journals. Just before I came last away, the LORD was
much amongst us; at which time, a young man, about twenty-one years
of age, was converted, who since has been made a blessed instrument of
converting many poor negroes in _South-Carolina_. Several others also,
that came to pay us a visit at the Orphan-House, were really brought
home to GOD, and now bring forth the fruits of the spirit in their
lives and conversations. How it has been with my family since my
departure, will best appear by publishing some extracts from the
letters which have been sent me from time to time, since my departure.


_Mr. Habersham_, superintendent of the outward affairs in the
Orphan-House, and who, I am persuaded, loves the LORD JESUS in
sincerity, writes me thus:

                                          _Bethesda, March 24, 1741._

_My dearest Friend and Brother_,

――――THE spirit of the LORD seems to be moving upon the faces of many
souls here; most, if not all the boys, seem to be under some concern;
little as well as great boys, cry mightily to JESUS the son of _David_,
to have mercy upon them. About fourteen days ago, at brother _Barber_’s
request, I spoke to the children at evening prayer. My soul at that
time was bowed down with a sense of my own, and especially of your poor
lambs deadness to GOD; but our gracious Redeemer, who is always ready
to help in time of need, was pleased to give me power to speak to their
consciences. I think I could and did justly appeal to their hearts,
that they wanted neither bodily or spiritual food: I told them, that
they, as well as myself, could not be insensible what little care was
taken of them before they came to us, and consequently how ungrateful
they were not to improve such means as they now enjoyed: I beseeched
them, by the mercies of GOD, that they would improve this their day of
salvation, that we and our benefactors might rejoice; we in the work
of our hands, they in the fruit of their bounty. An impression was made
on some; I observed them the next day retire into the woods, to sing
and pray together. Two nights afterwards, I spoke to them again, and
as I promised, so I returned them my public thanks for their little
amendment, with tears of love and joy: I felt the LORD powerfully on
my own soul, and it seemed to reach the children, and put them under
a visible concern. Ever since, brother _Barber_ has put the great boys
into two companies, and they constantly meet together every day to
sing and pray. _Saturday_, the 21st instant, the presence of the LORD
came down among the children, little and great, as they were talking
among themselves about eternity; and they cried so much to JESUS of
_Nazareth_, to have mercy upon them, that the family soon heard them.
We all went, saw, and wept over about twenty-five or thirty dear lambs,
upon their knees before GOD, some pleading the promises, and others
calling on JESUS. O how did my hard heart rejoice! Blessed be GOD, many
of them seem to retain their convictions, and all are serious. Does not
your soul leap for joy, and say, Bless the LORD, O my friends, and let
us magnify his name together! Indeed, my dear brother, all the glory
is due to him. Whilst I am writing, I blush, that I should mention any
thing about what I was only in a little measure an instrument. Methinks
I could wish to disappear, that the creature might be abased, and GOD
be all in all. I have great hopes that GOD will bring some effectually
to himself. The work seems to be more solid among them, and more the
effect of consideration, than that of last summer. I rejoice much, that
the LORD sent brother _Barber_ among us; for I have neither leisure
nor ability to speak much to the children, and he seems to delight to
watch over their souls: I trust the LORD will make him a blessing to us
all; I think it will be our own fault if he is not. One or two of the
labourers, I hope, have closed with JESUS for salvation; and one or two
more are in a fair way to do so.


                  Mr. _Habersham_, in another Letter,
                   writes thus from _Charles-Town_.

                                                     _June 11, 1741._

――――SATAN rages furiously against our Orphan-House in this province:
such lies and calumnies are raised against us, that our few dear
friends think it necessary for me to represent the present state of the
house. I have since been much in prayer, and believe GOD will direct me
how to act. Some here, since you went away, have gone great lengths in
asserting calumnies, even so as to offer to take oaths for the truth
of them. Since I came, I went to them, to enquire what foundation they
had for such reports; and it would surprise you to see their behaviour:
they are ashamed to lift up their faces. Thus shall the wicked stand
dumb at the bar of GOD. I think I can say, to the glory of GOD, that
our family never was in a better condition. The children, the _essence
of our constitution_, are well taken care of, and watched over. We
all live in love. GOD has been visibly among us, especially with the
children. _Bethesda_, as to its outward circumstances, is so much for
the better, that you would be surprised to see it. GOD enables us to
keep up much order. He likewise (blessed be his name) has given us the
appearance of a plentiful crop. The garden and plantation now afford
us many comfortable things, and in great plenty. Our stores are yet
well stocked with flour and beef, &c. Mr. _W――――_ behaves with great
integrity, and is faithful in his work. The house would be soon
finished, if we could get bricks. _J. S._ is ready to do all our
bricklayers work _gratis_. Brother _W――――_ is a great blessing to the
family. If you come by way of _Philadelphia_, pray bring some hemp and
coarse flax. He has weaved and spun a great deal for us. All the boys
now lye in the great house. They have also coats, and lye in sheets of
their own making: by this means they are kept sweet and clean. We have
a fine growing stock of cattle; and if GOD should so order it, that we
should have a plantation in _Carolina_, as I believe he will bring to
pass, we shall need but little, if any, assistance from abroad. If our
building were now done, our expences would be but trifling to what they
have been.


                     Mr. _Barber_ writes me thus.

                                       _Bethesda, September 4, 1741._

_My dearly beloved Brother_,

NOT knowing but our LORD may have business for you at the northward,
and send you thither before you return to us; I have sent you a few
lines, to acquaint you with the present state of your family. Many of
us have been sick; but, blessed be GOD, our sickness has not been unto
death. O that it may be for the glory of GOD’s name! All of us are in
good health at present, except _James M――――h_, who was taken with the
flux a few days ago, and _B. ♦Habersham_, who is much troubled with
the worms. I wish I could say our souls were in as good health as our
bodies are; but you may give thanks to the LORD, that he has made your
house a house of mercy indeed to some. A few weeks ago, the LORD was
pleased effectually to call _Thomas W――――b_; his conversion was very
clear, and much to the satisfaction of some, especially to his good old
father. Mr. _K――――y_, our taylor, and his wife, have been wrought upon,
I hope savingly, since they have been here: I am not without hope that
some of the children are likewise, and that the LORD in due time will
convert more of them. I hope he is now shewing us that the work is
wholly of him; that when the day of his power, the time, the appointed
time of his love is come, we may be better prepared to give all the
glory thereof to him. As to myself, I must confess that I am a poor
worthless instrument, to be employed in the work of the LORD; but what
shall we say, if the LORD is pleased to make use of the foolish to
confound the wise? I have, blessed be GOD, had a little freedom given
me lately to speak to your family; but I want to have my heart more and
more enlarged towards them, and to speak to them more and more in the
demonstration of the Spirit, and with power. Who knows? perhaps GOD
designs you should have the honour and happiness of being the spiritual
father of many more in your family. May the LORD’s will be done!

    ♦ “Haversham” replaced with “Habersham”


I have also some letters of a later date, which give an account of the
continuance of the LORD’s presence amongst them.

As for the temporal affairs, blessed be GOD, considering the great
difficulties we have laboured under, they also have succeeded far
beyond expectation.


         Mr. _Habersham_, in a Letter dated _March 24, 1741_,
                             writes thus:

AS we have got so much land cleared, I intend to try to plant it:
accordingly I have four or five hands, which, with our own houshold,
will be sufficient to plant twenty acres or upwards with potatoes and
rice for fodder next winter, having greatly suffered this, for want of
it; likewise corn and pease, and other necessaries. Our garden is in
great forwardness: we are like to have a crop of _English_ pease. GOD
visibly blesses us, so that people are amazed.


      In a Letter, dated _September 1, 1741_, he writes thus to a
       Gentleman in _New-England_: of which Letter I had a copy.

――――OUR affairs, blessed be GOD, have prospered far beyond our
expectation. We have seen, and do daily see, much of GOD’s fatherly
care, in providing for and protecting us; and though _we have no
visible fund_, yet we doubt not, but he that has begun, will carry on
and perfect his work against every opposition. We have been plentifully
supplied all the summer, while many about us lacked. Our building and
necessary conveniences, are now compleated. Our family now consists of
eighty-four persons, men, women, and children, and nineteen more are
employed about us, and five in the Infirmary: the latter have a doctor
and nurse, and all other necessaries found them at the Orphan-house
expence. We have fifty-eight children: thirty-two of them belong to
the colony; six to _Purisburgh_, who are, I think, as great objects of
charity as any in _Georgia_; and the rest belong to the neighbouring
provinces, who are orphans and objects of charity, except a few who
are maintained at their friends and parents charge. We have a taylor
and shoemaker: likewise two weavers; each of them have got a loom, but
we can employ but one, spinning here being extravagantly dear; though
we hope in a short time to spin as much _within ourselves_, as will
greatly assist in cloathing the family. GOD blesses our cattle; we have
upwards of an hundred head, small and great, and shall be able in a
year or two to kill a great quantity. Negroes not being allowed, and
labour among us so expensive, we can make but little improvement in
farming. This year we have planted upwards of twenty acres, and have
cleared twenty acres more for to enjoy the conveniency of the air: and,
blessed be GOD, though we have had a very dry season, yet we cannot
complain, like many others, of a bad crop. Honoured Sir, you may now
judge whether our design be drawing near a period. What I have written
is a plain impartial narrative of our affairs, which our bitterest
enemies will not pretend to gainsay. If any doubt it, I answer, as
_Philip_ did to _Nathaniel, Come and see_.


         In a Letter, dated _October 2, 1741_, he writes thus:

――――MR. _Wardrop_ and I have settled, his contract being finished:
he is about some necessary jobs now, and will leave us in a few days.
Messrs. _Trip_, _Anderson_, &c. are already gone: I owe them and Mr.
_Wardrop_ about seventy or eighty pounds. We are very quiet, and live
at an easy expence. We have had no supplies since you left us, of
flesh or bread kind from abroad, except some pork from Mr. _B――――_.
No _New-York_ vessels have come to this province of late. _We live
entirely within ourselves_, except a few necessaries which we cannot
do without, that we are obliged to purchase elsewhere. Twice a day we
eat _hominy_¹ of our own raising, and at present without molasses. For
dinner, we eat beef of our own stock, and pease for bread, of all which
we have plenty, and shall have for three months to come. Our garden
is very fruitful of greens, turneps, &c. and we expect a good crop of
potatoes. In short, we have a sufficiency of wholesome food. Glory be
to GOD, we daily see our heavenly Father’s hand supplying us in this
wilderness-land. O that we were more thankful! I must have cash, not
only to pay debts, but also to buy clothing and many other necessaries;
and I believe our GOD will give it to me. He is our shepherd, therefore
shall we lack nothing. I trust he has enabled us to pray in faith,
nothing doubting but he will supply our every want. All here at present
enjoy pretty good health. How thankful ought we to be! The LORD seems
to be sending his judgments abroad upon the earth. In _Carolina_ and
_Savannah_ a murrain is among the cattle, which takes off great numbers:
ours as yet have escaped. Thanks be to GOD! Indeed we are obliged
to kill some of them for immediate supply. But what are all outward
calamities, where GOD is?

  A young Gentleman of _Boston_, having made a visit to the
    Orphan-House, sent the following account of it to his father,
    which many have desired may be printed, for the satisfaction
    of those who have already contributed to its support.

                                         _Bethesda, January 1, 1742._

_Honoured Sir_,

BEING sensible of the many and false accounts industriously
spread abroad concerning this house in many places, especially in
_New-England_, by those who are enemies to its Founder, and the
cause he is engaged in, which has certainly been a great hindrance to
this worthy undertaking, as it has created even in its friends some
prejudices, which has hindered their contributing with that pleasure
and freedom they otherwise would have done; and as I am now upon the
spot, I think a few moments will not be ill spent, in giving you a
particular account of its present situation, which I shall endeavour
to do in the most just and impartial manner, that you may have an
opportunity of serving the interest in which your heart is so much
engaged.

The Orphan-House is pleasantly situated, and, with the buildings
belonging to it, presents a much handsomer prospect than is given by
the draught annexed to the public accounts. The great house is now
almost quite finished, and nothing has hindered but the want of glass,
which they daily expect from _Bristol_, and some bricks that are
already at _Savannah_, and are to carry up another stack of chimnies,
which would have been done before, if a vessel that was bringing brick
and other stores, had not been taken by the _Spaniards_, which was
a great loss. It is surprizing to see in what forwardness things
are, considering what hindrances they have had, and the scarcity of
labourers in this province. They have cut a fine road to _Savannah_
of twelve miles length, through a thicket of woods; and, that it might
be passable, were obliged to make ten bridges and cross-ways; which
was done at no little charge. They have also cleared forty acres of
land, twenty of which were planted the last year, and brought them a
tolerable crop: the other twenty was for the benefit of the air. They
have also a large garden at the front of the house, brought into pretty
good order.

The family now consists of eighty persons besides labourers, who all
contradict the wicked and false accounts of their being starved and
cruelly treated, by the lively and hearty countenances they shew. I
have seldom seen such a goodly number of youths together. Twenty-three
of them are orphans; others, that have lost one of their parents;
one was born in the house; and the rest are fit objects for christian
charity. There are in all thirty-nine boys, and ♦fifteen girls. The
number was larger some time past: but several of the boys, that were
well instructed, have been put to such trades as they inclined to; and
others, who were put here for their learning, are returned to their
parents, who have handsomely paid the House for their education.

    ♦ “fifteeen” replaced with “fifteen”

The care of this society at present is in the hands of a young
gentleman from _London_, who manages the secular affairs thereof; and
one from _New-England_, who has the care of souls as his particular
charge. There are two school-masters, who instruct the boys in reading
and writing: and those that appear serious, and of good capacities,
are taught _Latin_, with a design of fitting them for the ministry,
if they incline to it. Two school-mistresses, that teach the girls; a
surgeon and nurse to attend the infirmary, in which many sick persons,
from divers parts, have been received, and always been cured _gratis_.
Here are also several tradesmen; a taylor, a joiner, a weaver, and a
shoemaker. The taylor has three boys to instruct in his business. It is
expected that Mr. _Whitefield_ will increase the number of craftsmen,
when he returns from _England_. The œconomy observed here is as follows:
The bell rings in the morning at sun-rise, to wake the family. When
the children arise, they sing a short hymn, and pray by themselves:
then they go down and wash; and by the time they have done that, the
bell calls to public worship, when a portion of scripture is read and
expounded, a psalm sung, and the exercise begun and ended with prayer.
Then they breakfast, and afterwards go some to their trades, and the
rest to their prayers and schools. At noon, they all dine in the same
room, and have comfortable and wholesome diet provided. A hymn is sung
before and after dinner: then, in about half an hour, to school again;
and between whiles find time enough for recreation. A little after
sun-set the bell calls to public duty again, which is performed in the
same manner as in the morning. After that they sup, and are attended
to bed by one of their masters, who then pray with them, as they often
do privately. On the sabbath-day they all dine on cold meat provided
the day before, that none may be kept from public worship, which is
attended four times a day in summer, and three in the winter. The
children are kept to reading between whiles. Many have reported,
that the place is very unhealthy: which I believe is quite otherwise,
considering it is a new settlement: a remarkable proof of which is,
that not one have died out of the family, (into which many sick and
almost starved children have been received, who have in a short time
recovered) and but three or four out of the hospital, where many
miserable objects have been taken in. I believe many, who now think the
erecting an Orphan-house in that colony a mad scheme, would alter their
sentiments were they here. Innumerable difficulties have certainly been
overcome; but their affairs now look with a pleasant aspect. If the
colony is allowed negroes, as it is thought it must and will be, they
can, with about twenty negroes to manure the plantation, which contains
five hundred acres of land, raise much more provision than a larger
family than this can expend, having already a fine live stock, which
is daily increasing; so that in a few years, it is to be hoped, they
will be able to support themselves. As to the state of religion here,
particularly among the children, the power of GOD has, at times, been
visible among them; and many of them have been brought under conviction,
which seems lasting in some of the boys, and several of the girls: but
most of the grown folks appear to be truly converted; and many, who
have come as visitors, have been met with by the sovereign grace of GOD,
and not sent empty away: may GOD grant I may make one of that number!
Upon the whole, I think the institution to be of GOD: therefore it doth
and will prosper.


Since this came to my hand, I have received more letters from _Georgia_,
dated in _May_ and _June_ last, which also give me an account of the
continuation of GOD’s goodness to my dear family.

The Reverend Dr. _Colman_, in a letter he sent to a minister near
_Glasgow_, part of which I find printed in a pamphlet entituled, _The
State of Religion in New-England_, writes thus:

“Mr. _Whitefield_ visited us in the right time, and found large
contributions here: I doubt not but he will faithfully apply what he
collected for his Orphan-house: but I have said to him, It will appear
to me a greater wonder, if his faith is answered in that foundation,
than that of Monsieur _Franck_’s, at _Hall_, in _Prussia_, was: the one
being in the midst of _Europe_, the other on the confines of _America_.
But the order and piety of the house is admirable, and so the progress
of the settlement, alone as it is in the world, by the report of all
that have visited it: but how it can subsist and flourish, and answer
the Founder’s end, is the enquiry here, and will be a marvel in the
providence of GOD, if it do so.”

The Reader may see, by this, the Doctor’s opinion of the Orphan-house,
and the testimony given concerning it by persons who have visited
it, and who therefore cannot be unacquainted with its situation. They
profess, “The order of the house is admirable, and so the progress of
the settlement, alone as it is in the world.” How it can subsist and
flourish for the future, I am not solicitous about: GOD can help us in
_Georgia_, as well as he helped Professor _Franck_ in _Germany_. _The
earth is the LORD’s, and the fulness thereof_. I acknowledge him to
be the founder of that house: he put it into my heart to build it: it
has in a great measure already answered the end of its institution,
and I am persuaded will do so more and more. The greatest outward
difficulties, I humbly hope, are now surmounted. The workmen are all
discharged, having fulfilled their contract, and carried on the work so
far as to make every part of the house habitable. Our stock of cattle
is pretty considerable, and appear to be in a flourishing condition.
And, when once I am clear from all arrears, the Orphan-house will
be supported at a very easy expence. The last parliament resolved to
support the colony of _Georgia_: they have altered the constitution in
two material points; they have allowed the importation of rum, and free
titles to the lands. And if they should see good hereafter to grant a
limited use of negroes, it must certainly, in all outward appearance,
be as flourishing a colony as _South-Carolina_. Not that we are without
hopes, as Mr. _Habersham_ writes me word in his last letter, of making
a tolerable shift with white servants: the _Saltzburghers_ do so
already. There is a fresh body of them lately gone over, and some
fresh troops to guard the frontiers of the colony. Not that I put any
confidence in man, knowing that _the race is not to the swift, nor the
battle to the strong_, but Providence ruleth all things: but, at the
same time, I would act with the greatest caution and circumspection,
and not tempt GOD by presuming on him without a cause. His having
helped me and mine so often, encourages me to trust him again. He has
put it into the hearts of some dear friends to give Mr. _Habersham_
credit for cash during my absence; and his Excellency General
_Oglethorpe_ has been very friendly, having lent Mr. _Habersham_ fifty
pounds, and given the orphans nine barrels of flour: _the LORD return
him, and their other benefactors, ten thousand fold into their bosom_!

But all this while, some will say, you give us no account of your
collections in _Scotland_ and elsewhere for near this year and an half.
I will now do that to the best of my power, and likewise add an account
of my disbursements; I say, _my disbursements_: for, having had no
particular account of what Mr. _Habersham_ has expended and borrowed
since I have been from _Georgia_, I cannot possibly give an exact
account of the whole; but I shall do it, GOD willing, immediately after
my arrival at the Orphan-house, beginning where the former account
left off. From that it appears, I was then upwards of eight hundred
pounds upon arrears. Since that I have been absent near two years:
and considering a family of eighty persons, or upwards, have been
maintained, an infirmary kept up, the expence of further work done to
the house, &c. it will not appear unreasonable that I should be still
upwards of six hundred pounds on arrears; as I judge I am, from Mr.
_Habersham_’s general intimations of cash he had borrowed in _America_,
and what I have still to pay in _England_. But this will appear clear
in the next account. In the mean while, the following accounts, I
believe, will be satisfying to all the contributors¹: as for others,
I do not think myself obliged to give them any account at all, any
further than that I am commanded to _provide things honest in the sight
of all men_. Neither do I believe, that this, or any account I can
give, will satisfy captious men that are resolved to find fault: our
Saviour himself could not please such. And if even good men can be
so far prejudiced as to say, “The late glorious work at _Cambuslang_,
is all delusion, and a work of the devil,” I do not wonder if some of
his professed children speak all manner of evil of this undertaking:
neither should I wonder after this, if they should affirm there was no
such thing as an Orphan-house in being, though it was built but a few
miles off them.

    ¹ The accounts of particular receipts and disbursements are
      omitted, by reason of their vast length; and likewise, as
      the public have already examined them, and received full
      satisfaction.

As for the aspersions that have been cast upon me, as though I
collected money to enrich myself, it gives me little or no concern;
the apostle _Paul_ was branded as one that made a gain of people;
but GOD knows the heart: at the day of judgment I will prove those
persons liars. Professor _Franck_ met with unspeakably more contempt
and calumny, whilst he was building the Orphan-house in _Germany_:
he began very low, and left behind him an Orphan-house which contains
now, if I mistake not, two or three thousand students, notwithstanding
the erecting it, was attended with as many improbabilities as this
in _Georgia_: he has been dead about fourteen or sixteen years. His
son now succeeds him in the care of the Orphan-house: I have had the
pleasure of corresponding with him. An account of this Orphan-house
was printed in his life-time, and it has been very strengthening and
beneficial to my soul.

If any, by reading this, shall be inclined to contribute any thing,
either in money or goods, I trust GOD will give me grace to apply it
faithfully.

I am not ashamed to beg for GOD on this occasion; because my going to
_Georgia_, and erecting the Orphan-house, was one great means in his
hand, of bringing me out to preach the everlasting gospel in so many
places, and to many thousands of poor perishing souls, who I doubt not
(be it spoken with all humility) will evidence my commission thereto,
by being my joy and crown of rejoicing in the last day. Blessed be
his holy name, he has not left himself, nor me his servant, without
witnesses of this sort in _Scotland_! Many, I trust, since this time
twelvemonth, have been made to _taste that the LORD is gracious_, and
have in an effectual manner _felt the powers of the world to come_:
such in particular, I trust, will lift up holy hands in prayer for me,
and for the prosperity of the Orphan-house, that the enemies of our
holy religion may never have cause to triumph over its ruins, saying,
_There, there, so would we have it_. I look upon the Orphan-house as
a great part of my charge; a family given me by GOD, to be supported
and taken care of, for himself. Its very beginnings are not small; its
latter end, I believe, will greatly increase. He that believeth, should
not make haste to contemn the undertaking, or my conduct in carrying
it on, seeing it has already evidently appeared to be of GOD, by the
countenance and success he has given to both. And since the LORD, by
his providence, has connected the care of this family with my preaching
the gospel, by making it a means of first bringing me out, and ever
since has been pleased to continue the care of it upon me; I think
myself bound in duty, to recommend it in the strongest manner to all
people amongst whom I am called to preach the kingdom of GOD. Neither
do I think myself justly blameable for running so much in arrears on
its account, since the LORD, in all places where he has been pleased to
send me, has inclined the hearts of people to be ready to distribute,
and willing to communicate on this occasion: and, I doubt not, will
yet dispose the hearts of his people here and elsewhere, to be my
farther assistants by their charitable contributions, seeing I am
so necessarily engaged in the affair. _He that giveth to these_ poor
orphans, _lendeth to the_ LORD; and look, _Whatsoever he layeth out,
it shall be repaid him again_.

Those who, notwithstanding what has been said, still continue in
suspense, I would entreat them at least to pray for me, that in this,
and all my undertakings for the church of CHRIST, I may go on with an
even, humble, resigned, chearful mind, and single eye to GOD’s glory;
and then, I doubt not but they will see a happy issue of this work, and
future ages have reason to bless GOD, for ever putting it into my heart
to build an Orphan-house in _Georgia_.


                                                _September 22, 1742._

Since the writing of this, I have heard of the _Spaniards_ making a
descent upon _Georgia_. I cannot say the news of it damped me at all;
because, I humbly hope, the LORD will not give that colony over as a
prey into the enemy’s hand. The place where they landed, is about one
hundred miles to the southward of the Orphan-house: and, supposing
it should be taken, I do not repent the erecting it, because the
♦advantages that have flowed already from it, as appears from my
accounts, have abundantly answered the pains and expence it has cost.
What is due upon arrears, as it has been already laid out, and is a
debt contracted for GOD, I doubt not but he will incline the hearts of
his servants to help me by their contributions to discharge it. At the
same time, I am not without expectations, that this very attack of the
_Spaniards_ will be over-ruled for the good of the Orphan-house, and
be made a means of freeing the colony from their future insults: for
as _Georgia_ is a frontier colony, and stands as a barrier to all the
other _English_ provinces, it is reasonable to believe, they will all
unite in its defence and protection. But my trust is in the LORD; and,
through the mercies of the Most High, I humbly hope this undertaking
will not sink, but become more and more beneficial to _Georgia_ and the
neighbouring provinces day by day. _Let all that love the_ LORD JESUS
_say_, Amen!

                                                _September 27, 1742._

Since the foregoing papers have been in the press, I have received a
letter from Mr. _Habersham_, superintendant of the Orphan-house affairs,
in which he writes as follows:


                                           _Savannah, July 14, 1742._

_My dearest Brother and Friend_,

ABOUT four days ago I wrote you very fully in relation to our present
state and circumstances, from Mr. _John Bryan_’s. I hope our dear
family are well there. When my last comes to hand, you will find we
removed there for fear of the _Spaniards_, who came in upon _Georgia_
like a flood. I hope the General will yet stand his ground, though
the enemy is so numerous. I hear he destroyed and took one hundred and
seventy of the enemy last _Thursday_. GOD only knows what he is about
to do with us. Brother _Grant_ and I are here, to take care of our
house and goods. I hope GOD will direct us in our distress. Surely you
will now, if possible, come over. I believe the bearer is gone; I must
have done. Farewel, Farewel. Brother _Grant_ gives his love. I must
conclude by broken lines.

                                Yours,

                                                              _J. H._

P. S. Absolute hurry and necessity obliges me to write thus.


This letter gave me much comfort, as it brought me the welcome news
that my dear family was safe. This Mr. _Bryan_ was converted at the
Orphan-house, and is a wealthy planter in _South-Carolina_. I admire
the providence of GOD, in raising him up to take care of the little
lambs in this time of their distress. I hope ere now they are returned
to their _Bethesda_ in peace.

Blessed be GOD I have not been disappointed of my hope. For since my
return to _London_, I have received the following letters, which give
a more particular account both of their tryal and deliverance, and for
which I desire to praise our great and gracious GOD.


      From Mr. _Habersham_, at Mr. _Jonathan Bryan_’s Plantation
                  in _South-Carolina, July 11, 1742_.

_My dearest Friend and Brother_,

GOD’s ways are in the deep; the LORD only knows what he is about to do
with your dear family. Here at Mr. _Bull_’s and at Mr. _Hugh Bryan_’s
they sojourn at present, and all, blessed be our gracious JESUS, in
pretty good bodily health. Distress from the hands of the _Spaniards_
(under GOD) seems to be coming upon poor _Georgia_, and perhaps upon
this colony also. Our afflictions have been heavy: the LORD only
enabled us to bear up under them; but I really believe we have tasted
but the first fruits of our trials. Was it not for a persuasion that
GOD can, yea, will help us, we must sink under a prospect of impending
difficulties. About the 25th of last month several _Spanish_ galleys
came into _Cumberland_ sound, a little to the South of St. _Simon_’s,
where the General’s forces are encamped. The General himself in a deal
cutter, accompanied with two boats, was attacked by them, and had a
very wonderful escape. The gallies went off as though they would go
to _Augustine_; but a day or two after returned, attended with several
schooners, sloops, and ships of force to St. _Simon_’s. Several days
they lay within sight of the General’s camp. When we heard this, we
kept a day of fasting, prayer, and humiliation, to ask direction of our
great shepherd what we should do. As the _Spanish_ fleet had then made
no inroad upon the General, we concluded to _stand still_ and wait upon
GOD. The 5th instant the _Spanish_ fleet run into St. _Simon_’s _Sound_,
up the river that leads to _Frederica_. The fleet, I hear, consisted of
thirty-five or thirty-seven vessels; and notwithstanding the General
fired upon them from his battery, and two privateers, and other vessels
did the same, they passed without seeming to regard them, and landed
a great number of people at _Gascoign’s Bluff_ on St. _Simon_’s. The
General seeing himself encompassed about with enemies, ordered several
sloops, _New-Yorkers_, laden with provision to be sunk; his privateer
sloop was burnt, and Captain _Thomson_ and the ♦schooner made the
best of their way to the North. The General is now surrounded by the
_Spaniards_ upon an island, without having one vessel of any bigness to
carry him and his army off. He retreated from St. _Simon_’s (burnt all
the hutts, houses, &c. there) to _Frederica_, and gave leave for the
women and children, and I think all except his fighting people, to make
their escape.

    ♦ “scooner” replaced with “schooner”

The 17th instant several boats full of people passed by our house, and
informed us of the above, and that it was thought the General’s army
would be entirely cut off, unless great assistance was immediately
sent them, which it is likely could not be done soon enough. We all
met together, and prayed to our dear Father, and afterward desired
every one to speak their mind freely, what was necessary to be done
in this emergency. We considered it would be impossible to move so
many children, weak women, and babes in their arms away upon a sudden
approach of the enemy; that we were so locked in, that we could not
get through the _Narrows_ with our boats but four hours in twenty-four,
and unanimously agreed to move them away directly. But we had one great
objection to get over, the glory of GOD; we thought the providence
of GOD plainly pointed out our removal; and if the _Spaniards_ should
be permitted to take and burn all before them, we should be accessary
to the death of eighty-five poor creatures, and likewise bring a
reproach upon religion, through our disregard of using means for our
preservation. Our friends thought things might not be _so bad_ as
reported, and concluded to stay that evening at the Orphan-house, while
I should go to _Savannah_ to ask the advice of friends, and likewise be
better informed about it. Accordingly I went about nine that evening,
and returned at three in the morning. The news I had confirmed from the
persons who had fled from _Frederica_; and our friends at _Savannah_
advised us to move. Mr. _Jones_ offered to lend me any assistance to
do it. The next morning, as delays might be dangerous, we took as many
goods out of the house as the boats would conveniently carry with the
people. We had none about us but Mr. _K――――_’s and _G――――_’s family,
and two sick men in the infirmary, and in all made about eighty-five or
eighty-six persons. Then we had another difficulty to grapple with: we
knew not where to go. If we went to _Ebenezer_, we had no opportunity
of providing so large a body of people with provisions, and might be
in as much danger there as at _Bethesda_. If we went to _Carolina_, we
considered that it was there, in all probability, the enemy wanted to
be, and were destroying _Georgia_ in order to get there with the more
safety. But believing we should be better able to make our retreat to
the Northward from _Carolina_, if necessity should oblige us, and also
should be better able to supply the family with victuals, we came here
last night about twelve o’clock, and were received kindly by our dear
friends, who think we have done right in moving.


Mr. _Barber_ who superintends the spiritual affairs of the family, in
a letter dated near the same time writes,――“That as they were on their
passage, they heard guns firing all round them, which occasioned them
to think they were in the midst of their enemies.――This brought them
into straits, not knowing which way to take to avoid falling into
their hands.――But the LORD giving them to strengthen themselves in him,
they ventured on, and got safe to the shore; where they were informed,
that the guns they had heard, where in _Carolina_, firing to alarm
the province of the danger they apprehended they were in from the
_Spaniards_. What those guns were that they heard firing from other
quarters they did not know; most probably their enemies, whom the LORD
directed them to shun by taking the way they did.”


Mr. _Habersham_, again says,――How it is with _Georgia_, I have not
heard these three days; but as we left a great quantity of goods at the
Orphan-house, and fearing that it might be plundered, brother _Grant_
and I, with four hands, are in a few minutes to go there. I think, as
we have moved away the helpless people, if the enemy should come, we
can the better make our escape. O my brother, I hope you will not blame
us.――A sense of so many souls being liable to be destroyed, was very
burdensome, and called for speedy acting. I know not whether I shall
be ever able to write to you again. Perhaps some friends that I leave
behind me here may, and then they will tell you of all our difficulties.
It is hard to leave my dear friends and children, my wife and little
babe; but duty obliges me to go; I have no time to say any more; what
I have written has been in great hurry. Pray pardon my abruptness. If
I never see you, or write more, let me assure _you of my love_. I hope
I need not now use any arguments to persuade you to come over. Farewel,
farewel, farewel.

                           Yours, for ever,

                                                   _James Habersham_.

’Tis past one in the morning.


          From Mr. _Habersham_, at Mr. _Bull_’s plantation in
                  _South-Carolina_, _July 27, 1742_.

                                        _My dear Friend and Brother_,

I WROTE you the 4th, 11th, and 14th instant. Doubtless the contents of
my letters will give you some concern, and will be a means of hastening
you over to us. I hope you will find us at our desired habitation.
Hitherto the LORD seems to be on our side, and fights our battles. News
is lately come from the General, that the _Spaniards_ have moved off in
great confusion; but it is not sufficiently confirmed; when it is, we
purpose moving to _Bethesda_. In mine of the 11th instant, I informed
you, according to my knowledge of the state of your family, and the
colony till that time. I told you brother _Grant_ and self were just
returning to _Georgia_. We soon got there, and found our goods and
house safe. _John Goldwire_, I, and a boy, staid at _Bethesda_ while
brother _Grant_ went to _Carolina_, and returned with two boats. In the
mean time we heard the General had engaged twice with a party of the
_Spaniards_, and killed and taken one hundred and fifty of them, and
that the enemy was so intimidated, and the General’s army so encouraged,
that there was great expectations that the _Spaniards_ would soon be
drove off the island. GOD was pleased at this time to bring me very low
by bodily illness, so that I was almost incapable of making any escape,
if the enemy had been suffered to come upon us, having a hundred miles
to ride through bad swamps, to my friends in _Carolina_. Likewise there
was no one there, nor at _Savannah_, to give me any relief.

The 20th instant, having left three people at _Bethesda_, and our
family wanting necessaries at _Carolina_, brother _Grant_ and I
returned with most of our goods. When we now left _Bethesda_, we were
not very apprehensive of any danger of staying ourselves, or leaving
the goods there; but as I was obliged to seek for some assistance, and
our dear people wanted things we had there, we thought it was but a
very little more trouble to load the boats. I have many times intended
to write to you since I came here, but was not able conveniently till
to day, but I bless GOD I feel myself much better in health. As far
as I can learn, the General has behaved himself exceeding well, and
the LORD has wonderfully ordered things for him, contrary, I believe,
to his own and others expectations. His clemency to the _Spanish_
prisoners, his confidence, prudence, and courage throughout the whole
affair is so conspicuous, that his greatest enemies cannot impeach his
conduct. I don’t as yet hear, that he has lost (except by accident)
above three or four men. Indeed the hand of GOD has been evidently
against the boasting enemy. Some say near fifty vessels set out at
first to invade us, but in their passage, which is usually run in a
week or ten days, they were fifty days, and by some means fifteen of
them were separated from the rest, and did not come up to them at St.
_Simon_’s. They first proposed to land in _Carolina_, and cause an
insurrection among the negroes; to that end they brought a number of
negroes, to head and persuade our negroes (I suppose) to revolt. But
being so long on their passage, they wanted water, and were obliged to
put in at St. _Simon_’s. In their council of war there, they said they
would soon cut off the General and his few men, and did not doubt but
to settle and regain King _Philip_’s dominions, yea, even as far as
the Capes of _Virginia_. I should have wished you had been present
when we consulted about fleeing for our lives; it would have been great
satisfaction to us all; but I am of opinion, you would not have staid
with the great troop of little ones, under the apprehension of so much
danger. I have met with none but what have approved of what we did.

Every one, I believe, are willing to contract expences.――I hope, nay
I am assured, that all things shall work together for good; and I
am of opinion, we shall all have reason to bless GOD for every, yea,
especially for his late awful dispensation.――The deliverances we have
had are many and wonderful, and he that has done much can do more. In
regard to the _Spaniards_, they came like a flood, but the LORD can
save by few as well as by many.


                         From Mr. _Habersham_.

                                        _Bethesda, August, 19, 1742._

_My dearest Friend and Brother_,

I HOPE ere this reaches you, you have received mine of the 4th, 11th,
14th, and 27th of _July_ last, and that you see your way clear to come
to us. Blessed be GOD we have reason to conclude the _Spaniards_ have
entirely left the colony, and we are now very comfortably settled again.
The deliverance the LORD has wrought for us by the General, I think
is the most remarkable I ever heard or read of, except some instances
recorded in the Old Testament. It is so manifest, that “Surely GOD has
fought our battles,” is in the mouth of every one, whatever may be in
their hearts. I cannot now mention particulars, being much streightened
for time; at _Savannah_ the poor people are almost all sick; four have
been cut off. At _Frederica_ likewise, and at Mr. _Bryan_’s, and other
neighbours, they are in the same condition. We have also many down.
GOD has been chastising us with whips, but now seems to be scourging us
with scorpions. O that the goodness and patience of GOD may lead us to
repentance! We have a good crop on the ground, and have none to gather
it in but the few boys. Brother _Hunter_ has his hands full, and is
chiefly at _Savannah_. It is but little we buy abroad.――We hunt and
kill our own stock, and have potatoes and corn enough of our own. I am
but poorly, as is dear brother _Barber_, who is singularly useful at

SINCE the foregoing papers were sent to the press, I have received
letters from Mr. _B――――r_ and Mr. _H――――m_, the persons who superintend
the spiritual and temporal affairs of the Orphan-house, dated in
_October_ last; by which I am informed that all was well, and that the
family was mercifully supplied with things convenient for them. I don’t
hear that any of the family have been taken off by the late sickness;
but am informed of the death of one Mrs. _Dudding_, (a person converted
at the Orphan-house some time ago): she went with the family into
_Carolina_, where she staid after they returned, and there died
triumphantly.

Mr. _Bolzius_, one of the _Saltzburghers_ ministers, writes to me thus,

                       _Ebenezer_ in _Georgia_, _September 22, 1742_.

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

IT was with great satisfaction that I received the favour of your
letter, dated _M――――_ the 5th of _October_ last, in which you
acquainted me with the joyful news, that the LORD has been pleased to
bless your kind endeavours of collecting twenty pounds for our poor
people, on which our mill, and especially our Orphan-house had its
share according to your intention and order. This great blessing is
delivered into my hand by Mr. _H――――m_, our dear friend and favourer,
and is laid out in such a manner, that I hope, to have obtained the
end, at which you aim in all your actions, and in this act of love too,
_viz._ to promote the great giver’s, our heavenly father’s glory and
our people’s welfare. May it please an almighty and merciful GOD to
reward you and all our benefactors many-fold for this and many more
testimonies of your and their real favours, and let descend upon your
worthy person and holy ministry as many blessings to your spiritual and
temporal welfare, as prayers and hearty wishes do ascend to the throne
of grace from our hearts and lips in publick and private.

GOD has been pleased to visit me and my fellow-labourer with dangerous
sickness, but has graciously restored our health for our better being
prepared to the heavenly and blessed regions, and for being in some
measure, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, useful to shew our hearers
the way through CHRIST to the Father, and their eternal happiness. Many
in our congregation have been dangerously sick, and some died in peace;
the rest begin to recover by degrees. Good Dr. _Hunter_¹ has been
mighty useful and assistive to the inhabitants of _Savannah_ in their
long and dangerous sicknesses; and GOD has blessed his cures with very
good effects; and I am in hopes some people there will begin to be
sensible of the many blessings that flow from _Bethesda_ upon them,
and praise with us the LORD for his great kindness and mercy in having
raised this house of mercy to many grown people’s and children’s
spiritual and temporal welfare. If GOD should give me the pleasure of
seeing you here again, and being edify’d by your conversation, I would
humbly thank him for it; but if he is pleased to carry either of us
from this to a better world, then we will see not only one another
happily, but our glorious Redeemer also face to face for ever, to his
infinite praise and our eternal happiness, at which my brother _Gronau_,
myself, our families, and several of our congregation aim by all means
and strength, which GOD gives us from the merits of his beloved son,
our dear Saviour. To his infinite mercy and gracious conduct I commit
you, and me with our people, Orphan-house, my fellow-labourer Mr.
_Gronau_, and our families, who all salute you very heartily, to the
continuance of your favour and kind remembrance before GOD and men,
remaining sincerely,

             Reverend and dear Sir, your unworthy brother,
                     and humble servant in CHRIST,

                                               _John Martin Bolzius_.

_Sir_,

SOME months have I been here, and now think it high time, according
to my promise, to send you as explicit an account, as I well can, of
the _progress_, and _present situation_ of the Orphan-house. Some have
thought, that the erecting such a building was only the produce of
my own brain; but they are much mistaken. It was first proposed to
me by my dear friend the reverend Mr. _Charles Wesley_, who, with his
excellency General ♦_Oglethorpe_, had concerted a scheme for carrying
on such a design, before I had any thoughts of going abroad myself.
It was natural to think, that as the government intended this province
for the refuge and support of many of our poor countrymen, that numbers
of such adventurers must necessarily be taken off, by being exposed to
the hardships which unavoidably attend a new settlement. I thought it
therefore a noble design in general, to erect a house for fatherless
children. And believing such a provision for orphans would be some
inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the design, when
mentioned to me by my friend, and was resolved, in the strength of
GOD, to prosecute it with all my might. This was mentioned to the
honourable the trustees. They took it kindly at my hands; and as I
then began to be pretty popular at _Bristol_, and elsewhere, they wrote
to the _Bishop_ of _Bath_ and _Wells_, for leave for me to preach a
charity-sermon on this occasion in the abbey-church. This was granted,
and I accordingly began immediately to compose a suitable discourse:
but knowing my first stay at _Georgia_ would be but short, on account
of my returning again to take priests orders, I thought it most prudent,
first to go and see for myself, and defer prosecuting the scheme till
I came home: because I could then be better able to judge, whether the
scheme was practicable, and consequently could be able to recommend it
with the greater earnestness. When I came to _Georgia_, I found many
poor orphans, who though taken notice of by the honourable trustees,
yet through the neglect of persons that acted under them, were in
miserable circumstances. For want of a house to breed them up in,
the poor little ones were tabled out here and there, and besides the
hurt they received by bad examples, forgot at home what they learnt at
school. Others were at hard services, and likely to have no education
at all. Upon seeing this, and finding that his majesty and parliament
had the interest of this colony much at heart, I thought I could not
better shew my regard to GOD and my country, than by getting a house
and land for these children, where they might learn to labour, read,
and write, and at the same time be brought up in the nurture and
admonition of the LORD. Accordingly, at my return to _England_ in the
year 1738, to take priest orders, I applied to the honourable society
for a grant of five-hundred acres of land, and laid myself under an
obligation to build a house upon it, and to receive from time to time,
as many orphans as the land and stock would maintain. As I had always
acted like a clergyman of the church of _England_, having preached in
many of the _London_ churches, and as I had but a few months before
collected near a thousand pounds _Sterling_, for the children belonging
to the charity-schools in _London_ and _Westminster_; it was natural
to think, that I might now have the use at least of some of these
churches to preach in, for the orphans hereafter more immediately to
be committed to my care. But by the time I had taken priests orders,
the spirit of the clergy began to be much imbittered. Churches were
gradually denied to me. And I must let this good design drop, and
thousands (I might add ten thousands) go without hearing the word of
GOD, or preach in the fields. Indeed two churches, one in _London_
(_Spittle-fields_) and one in _Bristol_ (St. _Philip_’s and _Jacob_)
were lent me upon this occasion; but those were all. However, GOD
kept me from being discouraged. I collected for the Orphan-house in
_Moorfields_, two and fifty pounds one sabbath-day morning; twenty-two
pounds of which was in copper. It would have rejoiced your heart to see
the people give; they offered willingly, and took more pains to come
through the crowd and put their contributions into my hat, than some
would to have gotten them. Thousands of prayers were put up with the
alms that were given, and I trust both went up as a memorial before
GOD. In the afternoon I collected again at _Kennington-Common_, and
continued to do so at most of the places where I preached. Besides
this, two or three of the _Bishops_, and several persons of distinction
contributed; till at length, having about a thousand and ten pounds,
I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to _Georgia_. At that
time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I chose to take over only
a surgeon, and a few more of both sexes, that I thought would be useful
in carrying on my design. These chearfully embarked with me, desiring
nothing for their pains, but food and raiment. My dear fellow-traveller,
_William Seward_, Esq. also joined with them, and was particularly
useful to me on this occasion. Our first voyage was to _Philadelphia_,
where I was willing to go for the sake of laying in provision. Having
a Captain of a ship with me, who had been my spiritual child, by his
advice, I laid out in _London_ a good part of the thousand pounds for
goods; and by his care and that of my other fellow-travellers, without
any trouble to myself, got as much by them at _Philadelphia_ as nearly
defrayed the family’s expence of coming over. Here GOD blessed my
ministry daily, and begun that work in _Philadelphia_, which, I am
persuaded, will be remembered through the ages of eternity. _January_
following, 1739, I met my family at _Georgia_, and being unwilling to
lose any time, I hired a large house, and took in all the Orphans I
could find in the colony. A great many also of the town’s children
came to school _gratis_, and many poor people who could not maintain
their children, upon application, had leave given them to send their
little ones for a month or two, or more, as they could spare them, till
at length my family consisted of between sixty and seventy. Most of
the orphans were in poor case; and three or four almost eaten up with
lice. I likewise erected an _Infirmary_, in which many sick people were
cured and taken care of _gratis_. I have now by me a list of upwards
of a hundred and thirty patients, who were under the Surgeon’s hands,
exclusive of my own private family. This Surgeon I furnished with all
proper drugs and utensils, which put me to no small expence; and this
was still increased by clearing land, buying stock, and building a
large dwelling-house, sixty-feet by forty, and out-houses, commodious
for a large family to live in. Sometimes (labourers and all) I have
had a hundred and twenty to provide for daily. My friends, as well as
myself, seemed to have particular courage and faith given us for the
season; and we went on chearfully, believing that He for whose sake we
began, would enable us to finish this good work. About _March_ I began
the great house, having only about one hundred and fifty pounds in cash.
I called it _Bethesda_, because I hoped it would be a house of mercy to
many souls. Blessed be GOD, we have not been disappointed of our hope;
it has proved a house of mercy indeed to many. Several of our labourers,
as well as visitors, have (in a judgment of charity) been born of GOD
here, and given evident proofs of it, by bringing forth the fruits of
the spirit. Many boys have been put out to trades, and many girls put
out to service. I had pleasure the other day, of seeing three boys
work at the house in which they were bred, one of them out of his time,
a journeyman, and the others serving under their masters. One that I
brought from _New-England_ is handsomely settled in _Carolina_, and
another from _Philadelphia_ is married, and lives very comfortably at
_Savannah_. How so large a family has been supported in such a colony,
without any visible fund, is wonderful! I am surprized when I look back,
and see, how for these six years last past, GOD has spread a table in
the wilderness for so many persons. Were all the particular providences
that have attended this work recorded, perhaps they would be found
not inferior to those mentioned by Professor _Franck_, in his _Pietas
Hallensis_, whose memory is very precious to me, and whose example has
a thousand times been blessed to strengthen and encourage me in the
carrying on this enterprize. My being detained so long in _England_,
has been a little detrimental to me, my friends not knowing so well
how to act, because they expected to see me daily. And I cannot yet say
that I have surmounted the first year’s expence, which indeed was very
great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my friends have
had so many years experience in the colony. However, I doubt not, but
by the blessing of GOD, in a short time to pay off my arrears, and then
the family will be maintained at a small expence. My standing annual
charges are now but trifling to what they have been; and my friends
have raised an annual subscription sufficient for discharging it, till
the family may be able to provide for itself. This, GOD willing, I hope
will be, in a good measure, speedily effected. We have lately begun to
use the plow; and next year I hope to have many acres of good oats and
barley. We have near twenty sheep and lambs, fifty head of cattle, and
seven horses. We hope to kill a thousand weight of pork this season.
Our garden, which is very beautiful, furnishes us with all sorts of
greens, &c. We have plenty of milk, eggs, poultry, and make a good deal
of butter weekly. A great quantity of wool and cotton has been given
me, and we hope to have sufficient spun and wove for the next winter’s
cloathing. If the vines hit, we may expect two or three hogsheads of
wine out of the vineyard. The family now consists of twenty-six persons.
Two of the orphan boys are blind, one is little better than an idiot.
But notwithstanding, they are useful in the family, one in the field,
and the other in the kitchen. I have two women to take care of the
houshold work, and three men and two boys employed about the plantation
and cattle. A sett of _Dutch_ servants has been lately sent over: the
magistrates were pleased to give me two; and I took in a poor old widow,
aged near seventy, whom no body else cared to have. A valuable young
man from _New-England_ is my school-master, and in my absence performs
duty in the family. Sabbath-days the grown people attend public worship
at _Savannah_, or at _White-bluff_, a village near _Bethesda_, where
a _Dutch_ minister officiates. My dear friends who have hitherto
been my assistants, being married and having three or four children,
thought it best, as most suitable to the institution, to remove: GOD
has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably settled
at _Savannah_ and elsewhere: we frequently write to and hear from one
another. I need not trouble you with the order of our family. It is
pretty near the same as usual, and I do not think to make any material
alteration for some time. Many have applied to me to take in their
children as boarders, and erect a public school: but I have not yet
determined. It is certain such a school would be exceedingly useful in
this part of the world, if there should be a peace, not only for these
northern parts of the colony, but also for the more southern parts of
_Carolina_, _Purisburgh_, and _Frederica_, where are many fine youths.
I have been prevailed on to take one from _Frederica_, and another
from _Purisburgh_, and it may be shall admit more. For the present,
considering the situation of affairs, I think it most prudent to go
on making what improvements I can on the plantation, and shall bring
a tutor with me from the northward in the fall, to teach a few youths
the languages, and enlarge the family, when affairs are more settled.
The house is a noble commodious building, and every thing well adapted
for bringing up youth. Here is land to employ them in exercising
their bodies, and to keep them from idleness out of school hours. Here
are none of the temptations to debauch their tender minds, which are
common to more populous countries, or in places where children must
necessarily be brought up with negroes. What GOD intends to do with the
colony is not for me to enquire: secret things belong to him. It has
hitherto been wonderfully preserved, and the Orphan-house, like the
burning bush, has flourished unconsumed. In fine, the government has,
no doubt, its welfare much at heart: and, GOD willing, I intend to
carry on my design till I see the colony sink or swim. The money that
has been expended on the Orphan-house, and Orphan-house family, has
been of vast service to this northern part of the colony. And though
it has been greatly detrimental to my own private interest, yet I do
not repent of the undertaking. No, I rejoice in it daily, and hope
yet to see many more souls born unto GOD here. I have had a very
comfortable winter. The people of _Savannah_, having no minister till
lately, gladly accepted my labours; and at _Frederica_, the gentlemen
and soldiers of General ♦_Oglethorpe_’s regiment, as well as the
inhabitants of that town, received me very gladly. Major _Horton_
seems to behave very well; he has a very fine growing plantation. I saw
barley in the ear the first of _March_. _Georgia_ is very healthy. Not
above one, and that a little child, has died out of our family, since
it removed to _Bethesda_. I think the colony (were the inhabitants
sufficiently numerous) is capable of as good improvement as any on the
continent.

For the satisfaction of my friends, and silencing, if possible, my
enemies, I have had my accounts from the very beginning to _January_
last, publickly audited and examined, debtor and creditor, article by
article; and an oath for confirmation, being an end of all strife, I
have sworn to them. If it gives you or others any satisfaction, I shall
be glad. I have no more to add, but to beg a continued interest in your
prayers, and subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

            _The_ MEMORIAL _of_ George Whitefield, _Clerk_,

SHEWETH,

THAT about twenty-five years ago, your memorialist, assisted by the
voluntary contributions of charitable and well disposed persons,
at a very great expence, and under many disadvantages, did erect a
commodious house, with necessary out-buildings, suitable for the
reception of orphans, and other poor and deserted children; and that
with the repair of the buildings, purchase of negroes, and supporting
a large orphan family for so many years, he hath expended upwards of
twelve thousand pounds sterling, as appears by the accounts, which from
time to time have been audited by the magistrates of _Savannah_.

That your memorialist, since the commencement of this institution, hath
had the satisfaction of finding, that by the money expended thereon,
not only many poor families were assisted, and thereby kept from
leaving the colony in its infant state, but also that a considerable
number of poor helpless children have been trained up; who have
been, and now are useful settlers in this and the other neighbouring
provinces.

That in order to render the institution aforesaid more extensively
useful, your memorialist, as he perceived the colony gradually
increasing, hath for some years past designed within himself, to
improve the original plan, by making further provision for the
education of persons of superior rank; who thereby might be qualified
to serve their king, their country, and their GOD, either in church or
state. That he doth with inexpressible pleasure, see the present very
flourishing state of the province; but with concern perceives that
several gentlemen have been obliged to send their sons to the northern
provinces; who would much rather have had them educated nearer home,
and thereby prevent their affections being alienated from their native
country, and also keep considerable sums of money from being carried
out of this into other provinces.

Your memorialist further observes, that there is no seminary for
academical studies as yet founded, southward of _Virginia_; and
consequently if a college could be established here (especially as the
late addition of the two _Floridas_ renders _Georgia_ more centrical
for the southern district) it would not only be highly serviceable to
the rising generation of this colony, but would probably occasion many
youths to be sent from the _British West India_ islands and other parts.
The many advantages accruing thereby to this province, must be very
considerable.

From these considerations, your memorialist is induced to believe, that
the time is now approaching, when his long projected design for further
serving this his beloved colony, shall be carried into execution.

That a considerable sum of money is intended speedily to be laid out
in purchasing a large number of negroes, for the further cultivation
of the present Orphan-house, and other additional lands, and for the
future support of a worthy able president, professors, and tutors, and
other good purposes intended.

Your memorialist therefore prays your Excellency and Honours to grant
to him in trust, for the purposes aforesaid, two thousand acres of
land, on the north fork of _Turtle River_, called the _Lesser Swamp_,
if vacant, or where lands may be found vacant, south of the river
_Altamaha_.

          The ADDRESS of both Houses of Assembly in GEORGIA.


  To his Excellency JAMES WRIGHT, Esq. Captain General and Governor
    in Chief of his Majesty’s province of _Georgia_.

_May it please your Excellency_,

WE his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the council and
commons house of assembly of _Georgia_, in general assembly met, beg
leave to acquaint your Excellency, that with the highest satisfaction
we learn, that the Rev. Mr. _George Whitefield_ has applied for lands,
in order to the endowment of a College in this province. The many
and singular obligations _Georgia_ has continually laid under to that
reverend gentleman, from its very infant state, would in gratitude
induce us, by every means in our power, to promote any measure he
might recommend; but in the present instance, where the interest of
the province, the advancement of religion, and the pleasing prospect
of obtaining proper education for our youth, so clearly coincide with
his views, we cannot in justice but request your Excellency to use your
utmost endeavours to promote so desirable an event, and to transmit
home our sincere and very fervent wishes, for the accomplishment of so
useful, so beneficent, and so laudable an undertaking.

                     By order of the upper House.

             To which his Excellency was pleased to return
                         the following Answer.

_Gentlemen_,

I AM so perfectly sensible of the very great advantage which will
result to the province in general, from the establishment of a seminary
for learning here, that it gives me the greatest pleasure to find so
laudable an undertaking proposed by the Rev. Mr. _Whitefield_. The
friendly and zealous disposition of that gentleman, to promote the
prosperity of this province, has been often experienced; and you may
rest assured, that I shall transmit your address home, with my best
endeavours for the success of the great point in view.

  A Letter to his Excellency Governor WRIGHT, giving an account
    of the steps taken, relative to the converting the GEORGIA
    ORPHAN-HOUSE into a COLLEGE: Together with the literary
    correspondence that passed upon that subject, between his
    Grace the Archbishop of _Canterbury_ and the Reverend Mr.
    _Whitefield_.

_Honoured Sir_,

AS your Excellency, together with the members of his Majesty’s
honourable council, and house of representatives, were pleased at my
late visit to the Orphan-house, not only highly to approve of, but also
deeply to interest yourselves in the design of converting the present
_Georgia_ Orphan-house into a college; so I am persuaded, you make
no doubts but that ever since my arrival in _England_, _July 1765_, I
have exerted my utmost efforts in endeavouring to bring this important
affair to a desirable issue. To mention all the various circumstances
which have occurred during that interval, to impede and retard its more
speedy prosecution, would be tedious and unnecessary: I would therefore
only inform your Excellency, that about fifteen months ago, a memorial
was delivered into the hands of the late clerk of his Majesty’s most
honourable privy council. That this memorial was by him transmitted to
the Lord President, and by his Lordship referred to the consideration
of his Grace the Archbishop of _Canterbury_; that by his Grace’s
permission a literary correspondence ensued; but as that correspondence,
and with that, the negociation itself seems at an end, I think it my
duty, not only to lay an account of the whole before your Excellency in
particular; but, through your Excellency’s hands, before his Majesty’s
council and house of representatives of the colony of _Georgia_,
together with all the other _American_ colonists, and the public in
general, on both sides the water, who have so liberally contributed to
the promoting this design.

THAT about twenty-six years ago, your memorialist, assisted by the

commodious house, with necessary out-buildings, suitable for the
reception of orphans and other poor and deserted children; and that
with the repair of the buildings, purchase of negroes, and supporting
a large orphan family so many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve
thousand pounds sterling, as appears by the accounts, which from time
to time have been audited by the magistrates of _Savannah_, and which
are humbly presented with this memorial.

That your memorialist, since the commencement of this institution, hath
had the satisfaction of finding, that by the money expended thereon,
not only many poor families were assisted and thereby kept from leaving
the colony in its infant state; but also that a considerable number of
poor helpless children have been trained up, who have been, and are now
useful settlers in this and the other neighbouring provinces; that in
order to render the institution aforesaid more extensively useful, your
memorialist, as he perceived the colony gradually rising, hath for some
years past designed, within himself, to improve the original plan, by
making further provision for the education of persons of superior rank,
who thereby may be qualified to serve their king, their country, and
their God, either in church or state.

That in his late visit to _Georgia_, he did with inexpressible
pleasure see the province in a very flourishing state; but with concern
perceived that several gentlemen had been obliged to send their sons
to the northern provinces, who would much rather have had them educated
nearer home; and thereby prevent their affections being alienated from
their native country, and also considerable sums of money from being
carried out of _Georgia_ into other provinces.

Your memorialist begs leave further to observe, that there is no
seminary for academical studies as yet founded southward of _Virginia_;
and consequently if a college could be established (especially as
the addition of the two _Floridas_ renders _Georgia_ more centrical
for the southern district) it would not only be highly serviceable to
the rising generation of the colony of _Georgia_, but would probably
occasion many youths to be sent from the neighbouring southern
provinces for education. The many advantages accruing to _Georgia_
thereby, must necessarily be very considerable.

That in consideration of the foregoing premises, your memorialist, in
_December 1764_, presented a memorial to his Excellency the Governor,
and the honourable the council of the province of _Georgia_, praying
that two thousand acres of land might be granted in trust, towards
carrying on the desirable end of founding a College; which motion was
not only immediately complied with, but the general assembly being
then sitting, an address, a copy of which is herewith also sent, was
presented from them to his Excellency, expressing their unanimous
and highest approbation, with a desire that his Excellency would
use his endeavours to have this affair forwarded at home with all
possible expedition. That upon the arrival of your Memorialist, he
was informed that this address was remitted to, and laid before the
Lords Commissioners for trade and plantations; and having received
repeated advices, that numbers both in _Georgia_ and _South-Carolina_
are waiting with impatience to have their sons initiated in academical
exercises; your Memorialist therefore prays, that a charter upon
the plan of _New-Jersey_ College may be granted; upon which your
Memorialist is ready to give up his present trust, and make a free
gift of all lands, negroes, goods, and chattels, which he now stands
possessed of in the province of _Georgia_, for the present founding,
and towards the future support of a College, to be called by the name
of _Bethesda_ College in the province of _Georgia_.

_May it please your Grace_,

I THINK myself highly honoured in the L―――― P――――t’s referring a late
memorial to your Grace’s consideration; and as highly obliged to your
Grace, for the deep attention your Grace hath given to the copy of an
intended charter presented to your Grace by the E―――― of _D――――h_. The
inclosed will shew, what an almost implicit regard hath been paid to
your Grace’s wise remarks, and judicious corrections. I wish it could
have been altogether implicit; but circumstances are such, (as hath
been hinted to your Grace by L―――― _D――――h_) that I cannot, in honour
and conscience, _oblige_ the master of the _Georgia_ College to be
a member or minister of the church of _England_. Such an obligation,
I am persuaded, hath greatly retarded the progress of the College
of _New-York_; as on the contrary, the letter signed by your Grace,
Proprietor _Pen_, and the late Dr. _Chandler_; engaging, that
institution shall be continued on a BROAD BOTTOM, hath as much promoted
the growth of the College of _Philadelphia_. The trustees of that
seminary (as your Grace is pleased to observe) have agreed, “That their
Provost shall always be a minister of the established church.” But then
I would beg leave to reply, that they are not thereto _enjoined_ by
their charter. That is entirely silent concerning this matter: their
agreement is purely voluntary. The wardens of the College of _Georgia_
will not be prohibited by charter, from following the example of the
trustees of the College of _Philadelphia_. It is more than probable
they will never need it. The first Master will assuredly be a clergyman
of the church of _England_. By far the majority of the intended wardens,
are, and always will be members of that communion; and consequently
the choice of a Master will always continue to run in that channel.
My heart’s desire is, that some worthy duly qualified minister of the
church of _England_ may be always and readily found for that grand
purpose. But lest this should not always be the case, I dare not, as
persons of all denominations have been contributors, confine or fetter
the future electors. The monies gained by the _New-York_ lotteries, for
the erecting a college in _New-York_, were thrown in by persons of all
religious persuasions, in confidence, that the College would hereafter
be founded on an enlarged basis. And therefore, very great numbers,
may it please your Grace, think, and for ever will think themselves
injured, by its being confined within its present contracted boundary.
Hence it is, that many fine promising youths are almost daily sent
from the college in their native city, to that of _New-Jersey_. I dread
giving the same occasion of resentment and offence: and therefore am
determined to avoid it in the wording of the _Georgia_ College charter.
For the same reasons, I dare not enjoin the daily use of our church
liturgy. I love to use it, I have fallen a martyr, in respect to bodily
health, to the frequent reading it in _Tottenham-Court_ chapel; and it
has been constantly read twice every _Sunday_ in the Orphan-house, from
its first institution to this very day. The Wardens, when the power is
devolved on them, may determine this point as they please; but I cannot
enjoin it by charter: and have therefore, in this present draught,
not only omitted the paragraph concerning public prayer, but also that
concerning doctrinal articles. Perhaps your Grace may judge, that, all
things considered, saying nothing about either, may be a proper medium.
Your Grace further wisely observes, “That his Majesty should be very
well advised, whom he names for the first Master.” I trust he will.
I believe the Right Honourable the Earl of _D――――h_ will vouchsafe to
interest himself in the choice, and likewise be so good as to present
the first Master to your Grace’s approbation. The terms of ♦the charter
being not as yet settled, the choice of a Master cannot as yet be fixed
upon. When the former are ascertained, the latter may more easily be
applied for. In the mean while your Grace may be assured, that the lot
will not fall upon me. Alas! my shoulders are too weak for the support
of such an academical burden: my capacity, may it please your Grace,
is by no means extensive enough for such a scholastic trust. To be a
presbyter at large, is the station, which I think divine Providence
hath called me to, for near these thirty years past. During that
space, I trust my eye hath been in some degree single, and my views
disinterested; and my highest, my only ambition, during the feeble
remains of my future pilgrimage, I trust, will be this, That the last
glimmerings of an expiring taper may be blessed, and owned by the
great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, to guide some wandering sinners to
the practical knowledge of himself. I desire to bless his name, that
I have been spared long enough to see the colony of the once despised
_Georgia_, and the yet more despised Orphan-house, advanced to such a
promising height. My honoured friend and father, good Bishop _Benson_,
from his dying bed, sent me a benefaction for it of ten guineas,
and poured forth his most fervent dying breathings for its future
prosperity. That your Grace may yet live many years, to be happily
instrumental in promoting its welfare, both spiritual and temporal,
when turned into a college, is the earnest prayer of, may it please
your Grace,

          Your Grace’s most dutiful, obliged son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_To the Reverend Mr. Whitefield_,

THE Archbishop of _Canterbury_ hath put Mr. _Whitefield_’s draught
of a charter for a College in _Georgia_, into the hands of the Lord
President; who hath promised to consider it: but desires to know
from Mr. _Whitefield_, what present endowment, and to what value, he
proposes for his College.

_July 1, 1767._


                 _Mr._ Whitefield _to the Archbishop_.

                                              _London, July 4, 1767._

_May it please your Grace_,

MY obligations are much increased by your Grace’s putting the last
draught of the _Georgia_ College so speedily into the hands of the
Lord President. As by this, (I presume) it hath been honoured by your
Grace’s, so I make no manner of doubt, but it will also meet with his
Lordship’s approbation. In obedience to your Grace’s desire, I herewith
send your Grace an account of “what present endowment, and to what
value, I propose for the intended College.” Upon a moderate computation,
may it please your Grace, I believe its present annual income, is
between four and five hundred pounds sterling. The house is surrounded
with eighteen hundred acres of land; a plan of which, and likewise of
the house itself, I herein inclose, and humbly present for your Grace’s
inspection. The number of negroes young and old, employed on various
parts of these lands, in sawing timber, raising rice for exportation,
and corn with all other kinds of provision for the family, is about
thirty. Besides these, the College will be immediately possessed of
two thousand acres of land near _Altamaha_, which were granted me by
the Governor and Council, when I was last at _Georgia_; and a thousand
acres more, left, as I am informed, by the late reverend and worthy
Mr. _Zubberbuler_. So that, by laying out only a thousand pounds
in purchasing an additional number of negroes, and allowing another
thousand for repairing the house, and building the two intended wings,
the present annual income may very easily and speedily be augmented
to a thousand pounds _per annum_. Out of this standing fund, may be
paid the salaries of the Master, professors, tutors, &c. and also small
exhibitions be allowed for some orphan or other poor students, who
may have their tutorage and room-rent gratis, and act as servitors to
those who enter commoners. What these salaries and exhibitions ought
to be, may at a proper season be submitted to your Grace’s future
consideration. At present, I would only further propose, that the
negroe children belonging to the College, shall be instructed, in their
intervals of labour, by one of the poorer students, as is done now
by one of the scholars in the present Orphan-house. And I do not see
why an additional provision may not likewise be made for educating and
maintaining a number of _Indian_ children, which, I imagine, may easily
be procured from the _Creeks_, _Choctaws_, _Cherokees_, and the other
neighbouring nations. Hence the whole will be a free-gift to the colony
of _Georgia_: a complex extensive charity be established; and at the
same time, not a single person obliged, by any public act of assembly,
to pay an involuntary forced tax towards the support of a seminary,
from which many of the more distant and poorer Colonist’s children
cannot possibly receive any immediate advantage; and yet the whole
Colony, by the christian and liberal education of a great number of its
individuals, be universally benefited. Thus have I most readily, and I
humbly hope, gratefully complied with your Grace’s desire, which to me
is as a command. I am constrained to trespass on your Grace’s patience,
whilst I congratulate your Grace on the goodness of GOD, who, amongst
many other signal marks of his peculiar providence, hath honoured
your Grace, in making you an happy instrument of establishing two
_Northern-American_ Colleges; the one at _New-York_, and the other at
_Philadelphia_: and if (as I pray may be the case) your Grace should
yet be made further instrumental in establishing a third College in the
yet more southern, but now flourishing colony of _Georgia_, I trust it
will be an additional gem in the crown, which I earnestly pray that GOD,
the righteous judge, may give your Grace in that day. In his great name,
I beg leave to subscribe myself, may it please your Grace,

          Your Grace’s most dutiful, obliged son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_May it please your Grace_,

AS I am going out of town for a few weeks, I beg leave humbly to
enquire, whether my L―――― P――――t hath considered the draught of the
charter sent him by your Grace some weeks ago. The Governor, Council,
Assembly, and other inhabitants of _Georgia_, wait with impatience to
have this affair brought to a desired issue; and therefore I humbly
hope your Grace will excuse the freedom of the request now made by,
may it please your Grace,

          Your Grace’s most dutiful, obliged son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_May it please your Grace_,

BY a series of unaccountable incidents and mistakes, your Grace’s
letter, with that of the L―――― P――――t, did not reach me till this
afternoon. I have made bold to copy the letter; and in obedience
to your Grace’s command, herewith return the original. Its contents
shall be immediately and duly considered, and an answer very speedily
remitted to your Grace. In the mean time, with most humble thanks for
the zeal and punctuality shewn by your Grace in the prosecution of this
important affair, and earnestly begging an interest in your Grace’s
prayers, that I may be kept from erring on the right hand, or the left,
in this final discharge of my public trust, I beg leave to subscribe
myself, may it please your Grace,

        Your Grace’s most obedient and dutiful son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_May it please your Grace_,

AFTER earnest application to the Father of mercies for direction,
I have endeavoured as in his presence, duly to consider and weigh
the contents of the L―――― P――――t’s letter, which your Grace was so
condescending as to transmit for my perusal. His L――――p therein,
is pleased to inform your Grace, “That he observes, that the second
draught of Mr. _Whitefield_’s charter, differs from that of _New-York_;
in not requiring the head of the College to be a member of the church
of _England_, which his Lordship thinks so material a qualification,
that for one, he should not be for dispensing with it. And his L――――p
is also of opinion, that the public prayers should not be extempore
ones, but the liturgy of the church, or some part thereof, or some
other settled and established form.” Thus far his L――――p. And, as I
profess myself to be a presbyter of the same communion with his L――――p,
I cannot but applaud his L――――p’s zeal for, and watchfulness over, the
honour of the established church. But if his L――――p would be so good
as to take a particular view of the point of light in which I stand,
I cannot help flattering myself, but that his L――――p will be so far
from thinking, that being a member of the church of _England_ is a
qualification not to be dispensed with in the head of the intended
College; that on the contrary, it ought not so much as to be mentioned,
or insisted upon in the charter at all. For not to trouble your Grace
with a repetition of the reasons urged against such a restraining
clause, in my letter of _June 17_; I would beg leave further to observe
to your Grace, that by far the greatest part of the Orphan-house
collections and contributions came from Dissenters, not only in
_New-England_, _New-York_, _Pensylvania_, _South-Carolina_, and
_Scotland_, but in all probability here in _England_ also. Most
of these places I have visited since the several audits of the
Orphan-house accompts, and acquainted with the design of turning it
into a College; and likewise the address of the Council and Assembly
of the province of _Georgia_, with his Excellency Governor _Wright_’s
answer, highly approving and recommending the design, have been
published. Being frequently asked, “Upon what bottom the intended
College was to be founded;” I not only most readily and repeatedly
answered, “Undoubtedly upon a _broad bottom_;” but likewise, in most
of the above-mentioned places, have solemnly declared from the pulpit,
that it should be upon a _broad bottom, and no other_. This, I judged,
I was sufficiently warranted to do, from the known, long established,
mild, and uncoercive genius of the _English_ government; also from
your Grace’s moderation towards protestant Dissenters; from the
unconquerable attachment of the _Americans_ to toleration principles,
as well as from the avowed habitual feelings and sentiments of my own
heart. This being the case, may it please your Grace, I would humbly
appeal to his L――――p, whether I can answer it to my GOD, my conscience,
my king, my country, my constituents, and Orphan-house benefactors
and contributors, both at home and abroad, to betray my trust, forfeit
my word, act contrary to my own convictions, and greatly retard and
prejudice the growth and progress of the intended institution, by
narrowing its foundation, and thereby letting it fall upon such a
bottom, as I am persuaded will give a general disgust, and most justly
open the mouths of persons of all denominations against me. This, as
I acquainted your Grace, in the same letter referred to above, is what
I dare not do. And therefore, as your Grace by your silence seems to
be like-minded with the L――――d P――――t; and as your Grace’s and his
L――――p’s influence will undoubtedly extend itself to others of his
Majesty’s most Honourable Privy-Council, I would beg leave, after
returning all due acknowledgments, to inform your Grace, that I intend
troubling your Grace and his Lordship no more about this so long
depending concern. As it hath pleased the great Head of the church
in some degree to renew my bodily strength, I purpose now to renew
my feeble efforts, and turn the charity into a more generous, and
consequently into a more extensively useful channel. If I know any
thing of my own heart, I have no ambition to be looked upon at present,
or remembered for the future, as a founder of a college; but I would
fain, may it please your Grace, act the part of an honest man, a
disinterested minister of JESUS CHRIST, and a truly catholic, moderate
presbyter of the church of _England_. In this way, and in this only,
can I hope for a continued heart-felt enjoyment of that peace of GOD,
which passeth all understanding, whilst here on earth, and be thereby
prepared to stand with humble boldness before the awful, impartial
tribunal of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls at the great day.
That your Grace may shine as a star of the first magnitude in that day,
is the sincere prayer of, may it please your Grace,

          Your Grace’s most dutiful obliged son and servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_May it please your Grace_,

THE bearer is my humble friend; one who hath been with me several years,
and been my companion in travel through the continent of _America_.
If your Grace would be so good as to send by him the plans and papers
relating to the Orphan-house, it would much oblige, may it please your
Grace,

               Your Grace’s most dutiful humble servant,

                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ I know not whether your Grace or the Lord President hath the
copy of the _New-Jersey_ College charter. I gave it to Mr. Secretary
_Sharp_, in order that your Grace and his Lordship might see it.
Mr. _Sharp_ being dead, obliges me to trouble your Grace with this
particular: I should not otherwise have taken the freedom.

                                _Tottenham-Court, February 12, 1768._

_May it please your Grace_,

AS not only the Governor, Council and Assembly of _Georgia_, have been
for a long season, and are now waiting for an account of what hath been
done in respect to the affair of the intended _Bethesda_ college, I
find myself under a necessity of giving them and the contributors, on
this, as well as the other side of the water, a plain narration of the
steps I have been taking; and at the same time I intend to lay before
the public a draught of the future plan, which, GOD willing, I am
now determined to prosecute. And as the letters which I have had the
honour of writing to your Grace, contain most of what I have to say
on this subject, I suppose your Grace can have no objection against my
publishing those letters, together with the answers returned, and the
issue of the correspondence. To prevent your Grace’s having further
trouble, as I hear your Grace is at present much indisposed, I shall
look upon silence as an approbation, at least as a tacit allowance of
what is designed by, may it please your Grace,

             Your Grace’s most dutiful son and servant, in
                 the King of kings and Lord of lords,

                                                              _G. W._

THUS, may it please your excellency, concluded my correspondence with
his Grace, and I humbly hope, the province of _Georgia_, in the end,
will be no loser by this negociation. For, GOD willing, I now purpose
to add a public academy, to the Orphan-house, as the college¹ of
_Philadelphia_ was constituted a public academy, as well as charitable
school, for some time before its present college charter was granted by
the honourable proprietors of _Pensylvania_ in the year 1755.

    ¹ This college was originally built, above twenty-eight years
      ago, for a charity school and preaching place for me, and
      ministers of various denominations, on the bottom of the
      doctrinal articles of the church of _England_. The trustees,
      as a public and standing acknowledgment of this, have
      inserted a clause in their Grant, for leave for a part
      of the building still to be allowed for that purpose.
      Accordingly I preached a sermon in it, for the benefit of
      their charity children, when I was last at _Philadelphia_,
      before a very large auditory, and Dr. _Smith_, the present
      Provost, read prayers.

In pursuing a like plan, the present _Georgia_ Orphan-house estate,
which for near these three years hath been in a state of suspense, may
be vigorously and properly improved, and thereby an ample and lasting
provision made for the future maintenance and education of many poor,
indigent, and orphan, as well as more opulent students. Proper masters
likewise may now be sent over to instruct, and prepare for academical
honours the many youths, who are at this time both in _Georgia_ and
the adjacent provinces, waiting for admission. In the mean time, a
proper trust may be formed to act after my decease, or even before,
with this proviso, that no opportunity shall be omitted of making fresh
application for a college charter, upon a _broad bottom_, whenever
those in power shall think it for the glory of GOD, and the interest
of their king and country to grant the same. And thus, may it please
your Excellency, my beloved _Bethesda_ will not only be continued as a
house of mercy for poor orphans, but be confirmed as a seat and nursery
of sound learning, and religious education, I trust, to the latest
posterity. That this may be the happy case, as I am persuaded is the
desire of your Excellency, his Majesty’s Honourable Council, and house
of representatives, in the province of _Georgia_, so it shall still be,
to my latest breath, as it hath been for many years, the earnest
endeavour and incessant prayer of,

         May it please your Excellency, Your Excellency’s, &c.

                                                              _G. W._


               _Commons House of Assembly, Monday, January 29, 1770._

MR. Speaker reported, that he with the house having waited on the
Reverend Mr. _Whitefield_, in consequence of his invitation, at the
Orphan-house academy, heard him preach a very suitable and pious
sermon on the occasion; and with great pleasure observed the promising
appearance of improvement towards the good purposes intended, and the
decency and propriety of behaviour of the several residents there;
and were sensibly affected, when they saw the happy success which
has attended Mr. _Whitefield_’s indefatigable zeal for promoting the
welfare of the province in general, and the Orphan-house in particular.

         Ordered, That this report be printed in the Gazette.

LAST _Sunday_ his Excellency the Governor, Council and Assembly, having
been invited by the Reverend Mr. _George Whitefield_, attended at
divine service in the chapel of the Orphan-house academy, where prayers
were read by the reverend Mr. _Ellington_, and a very suitable sermon
was preached by the reverend Mr. _Whitefield_ from _Zechariah_ ivth
chapter 9th. and part of the 10th verses; “_The hands of Zerubbabel
have laid the foundation of this house, his hands shall also finish
it; and thou shalt know, that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto
you; for who hath despised the day of small things?_” to the general
satisfaction of the auditory; in which he took occasion to mention the
many discouragements he met with, well known to many there, in carrying
on this institution for upwards of thirty years past, and the present
promising prospect of its future and more extensive usefulness. After
divine service, the company were very politely entertained with a
handsome and plentiful dinner; and were greatly pleased to see the
useful improvements made in the house, the two additional wings for
apartments for students, one-hundred and fifty feet each in length, and
other lesser buildings, in so much forwardness, and the whole executed
with taste and in a masterly manner; and being sensible of the truly
generous and disinterested benefactions derived to the province through
his means, they expressed their gratitude in the most respectful terms.

the use of the same, from the 9th _February_ 1765, to this day, amount
to two thousand five hundred forty-eight pounds seventeen shillings
and one half-penny, sterling; and the sums received, to one thousand
three hundred thirteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence three
farthings, sterling; and that the whole of the sums expended on
account of the institution, amount to fifteen thousand four hundred
and four pounds two shillings and five-pence farthing, sterling, and
the whole receipts, to the sum of twelve thousand one hundred four
pounds nineteen shillings and one penny half-penny, sterling; and the
benefactions of the Rev. Mr. _George Whitefield_ thereunto, have, at
different times, amounted to the sum of three thousand two hundred
ninety-nine pounds three shillings and three-pence three farthings,
sterling, as clearly appears by a general account thereof stated by
us. And that in this our last, as well as each preceding audit, no
charge whatever has been made by the Rev. Mr. _Whitefield_, either for
travelling charges or otherwise, nor any other charge for the salary
of any person whatever, employed or concerned in the management of the
said Orphan-house; and that clear and distinct vouchers for the whole
amount of the sums expended, have been laid before us, except for four
articles, amounting together to forty pounds one shilling and one penny,
being monies expended and paid by the said Mr. _Whitefield_ on several
occasions, the particulars of which were laid before us, but no receipt
had been by him taken for the same.

  SCHEDULE of all the Lands possessed by, and belonging to the
    late Reverend _George Whitefield_, in _Georgia_.

  Lands granted by his Majesty to the late Reverend _George
    Whitefield_, in trust for the Orphan-house, or for the
    endowment of a College in _Georgia_.

  A TRACT of  500 acres, called _Bethesda_, on which the
                  Orphan-house and additional buildings are
                  erected.

  Another of  419 acres, called _Nazareth_.

  Another of  400 acres, called _Ephrata_, on which are the
                  principal planting improvements.
             ────
             1319 acres.
             ────
                    These lands are granted in trust to the
                  deceased, for the use of the Orphan-house, and
                  adjoin each other: the grants are dated 13th of
                  _April_, 1761.

  Another of  500 acres, called _Huntingdon_, and adjoins on one
             ──── corner to _Ephrata_.――This grant is dated 13th
                  of _April_, 1761.

  Another of 1000 These 3 tracts, amounting to 2000 acres are
  Another of  500   contiguous, and are granted to the deceased
  Another of  500   in trust for the endowment of a college. The
             ────   grants are dated 6th of _August_, 1765.
             2000

  Another of 1000 acres, left by the Reverend _Bartholomew
                    Zouberbuhler_, deceased, late minister of
                    _Savannah_, by Will, for the endowment of
                    a college, but conditionally.

The habendum of the three grants, amounting to 1319 acres of land,
for the use of the Orphan-house, run in the following words: “To have
and to hold the said tract of four hundred acres of land, and all and
singular other the premises hereby granted, with the appurtenances,
unto the said _George Whitefield_, his heirs and assigns for ever,
in free and common soccage:――_In trust nevertheless for the use and
benefit of the Orphan-House_,――he the said _George Whitefield_, his
heirs or assigns, yielding and paying, &c.”

And the three grants, together amounting to 2000 acres of land, for
the endowment of a college, are thus expressed: “To have and to hold
the said tract of one thousand acres of land, and all and singular
other the premises hereby granted, with the appurtenances, unto the
said _George Whitefield_, his heirs and assigns for ever, in free and
common soccage: _In trust for the endowment of a college in our said
province_,――he the said _George Whitefield_, his heirs and assigns,
yielding and paying, &c.”

So that it plainly appears, these lands cannot be aliened or
appropriated to any other use, than the purposes for which they
were granted.

_N. B._ The _Spanish_ war; the fluctuating state of the colony
for years; the long suspense in which Mr. _Whitefield_ was kept by
government at home, as to his intended plan of improvement at the
Orphan-house; and other particulars which are noticed, and may be
observed in his letters, prevented the accession of a greater number of
orphans; but to the honour and usefulness of the institution, it ought
to be remarked, that many poor children, besides what are numbered in
this list, were occasionally received, educated, and maintained at the
Orphan-house.

    in Mr. _Whitefield_’s hand-writing, 1770.

MORNING prayer to begin constantly, every day in the year, at half
after five. The first bell to ring exactly at 5 o’clock. The form
as follows: A psalm or hymn; the general confession, introduced with
“Let us pray.” If any scholar of the house, or any other person not
in priest’s orders, doth officiate, then that collect, “O GOD, whose
nature and property, &c.” or that out of the commination-office, “O
LORD, we beseech thee mercifully hear our prayers, &c.” Then must
follow the Lord’s prayer, _Gloria Patri_, “O come let us sing unto
the LORD, &c.” or the _Te Deum_, or Song of the Three Children, or
_Benedictus_; then the second lesson for the day, with a few short
practical remarks; then a suitable prayer, with singing a short
doxology; and thus to conclude, “The grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST,
and the love of GOD, and fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us,
the Founder of this institution, the Master, Wardens, and all its
benefactors, and all mankind, now, henceforth, and for evermore.” If
no one is capable of using free prayer, then shall follow the apostles
creed, the collect for the week, the third collect for grace; the three
prayers for the king, royal family, and clergy, turned into one; “O GOD,
the creator;” the general thanksgiving, the prayer of St. _Chrysostom_,
and “Grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST,” as before.

The same order in the evening, only to repeat the _Magnificat_, &c.
before the reading of the second lesson.

On _Wednesday_ and _Friday_ morning, the hymn, the litany, the general
thanksgiving, prayer of St. _Chrysostom_, and concluding prayer.

On _Sunday_ morning, a short prayer with a psalm or hymn early in
the morning. Full prayers and sermon at ten: the same at three in the
afternoon. A short prayer, and a hymn, at half after six in the evening.
The first lesson to be read at dinner; the same at supper: a short hymn
at each meal. One of the orphans to read and give out the hymn, or any
other substituted by the master; and also to read the second lesson in
chapel.

Great care to be taken, that all read, write, speak, and behave
properly.

All the statutes to be in _English_, and read to every scholar or
student at admission, and thrice a year, at _Easter_, _Whitsuntide_,
and _Christmas_, publicly.

No cards, dice, or gaming of any kind to be allowed, on pain of
expulsion, or dismission, by masters, tutors, professors, students or
any officer or member of the college whatsoever. No music but divine
psalmody; such as _Butt’s Harmonia sacra_, _Knibb_’s and _Madan_’s
collection of tunes.

All are to be taught _Bland’s Manual Exercise_, by some deputed officer,
but not bound to attend on musters or other exercises, unless on
account of an alarm.

Nobody shall be suffered to run in arrears above half a year: some
caution money to be paid down.

All students to furnish their own rooms, but to lie on mattresses, and
the successors to pay thirds.

No one suffered to go to town without express leave from the master, or
persons deputed by him.

Breakfast at seven o’clock, dinner at twelve, supper at six, through
all the year; the utmost neatness to be observed and maintained in
every room.

All orphans and students shall be obliged to learn and repeat, and,
if capable, to translate into _Latin_ all the thirty-nine articles,
or those specified in the act of toleration. The homilies to be read
publicly, distinctly, frequently and carefully, every year, by the
students, deputed in rotation. All to be first thoroughly instructed
in the history of _Georgia_, and constitution of _England_, before they
are taught the history of _Greece_ and _Rome_. _Kimber_’s history of
_England_ is a good one for beginners, then may follow _Rapin_’s. The
young negro boys to be baptized and taught to read. The young negro
girls to be taught to work with the needle. The following divinity
books to be read, _Henry_’s _Comment_,――_Doddridge_ and _Guise_,
――♦_Burkitt_,――_Clark_’s _Bible_,――_Wilson_’s _Dictionary_,――Professor
_Franck_’s _Manuductio_, especially the preface _de Impedimentis Studii

      of this work.

WHEN I consider where I stand, and before whom I am about to speak, no
wonder that previous to my rising, a trembling seized my limbs; and now,
when risen, a throbbing seizes my heart, and as a consequence of both,
shame and confusion cover my face. For what am I? (a poor _unlettered
orphan_, unlearned almost in the very rudiments of my mother tongue,
and totally unskilled in the persuasive arts of speaking) that I should
be called to speak before such a venerable, august assembly, as is this
day convened under _Bethesda_’s roof. But when I reflect, that I stand
up at your command, Reverend Sir, to whom, under GOD, I owe my little
all, and when I further reflect on the well-known candour of those
that compose this venerable, august assembly, my trembling begins to
abate, my throbbing ceases, and a gleam of hope breaks in, that the
tongue of the stammerer will in some degree be able to speak plain.
But where shall I begin, and how shall I express the various emotions,
that within the space of the last hour have alternately agitated and
affected my soul? If the eye, as I have been taught to think, is the
looking-glass of the soul; and if the outward gestures, and earnest
attention, are indications and expressive of the inward commotions and
dispositions of the human heart, then a heart-felt complacency and joy
hath possessed the souls of many in this assembly, whilst the reverend
Founder hath been giving from the pulpit such a clear, succinct,
and yet withal affecting account of the rise and progress of this
Orphan-house academy, and of the low estate of this now flourishing
colony, when the first brick of this edifice was laid. All hail that
happy day! which we now commemorate, when about thirty-two years ago,
in faith and fervent prayer, the first brick of this edifice was laid.
Many destitute orphans were soon taken in, and without any visible
fund, in the dearest part of his Majesty’s dominions, more than fifty
labourers were employed, and honourably paid, and a large orphan-family,
for these many years, hath been supported, cloathed, and brought up in
the nurture and admonition of the LORD. O could these walls speak!
could every chamber, every corner of this fabric speak! what agonizing
supplications, what inwrought energetic prayers would they tell us they
had been witness to, and also of the blessed fruits, of which we are
now partakers. Behold! a once infant, deserted, despised colony, not
only lifting up its drooping head, and in some degree over-topping, at
least for trade, and increase and extent of commerce, vying with some
of its neighbouring provinces. Behold the once despised institution!
(the very existence of which was for many years denied) through the
indefatigable industry, unparalleled disinterestedness, and unwearied
perseverance of its reverend Founder, expanding and stretching its
wings, not only to receive a larger number of helpless orphans like
myself, but to nurse and cherish many of the present rising generation,
training them up to be ornaments both in church and state. For ever
adored be that Providence, that power and goodness, which hath brought
matters to such a desirable and long expected issue! Thanks, thanks
be rendered to _your Excellency_, for the countenance you have always
given to this beneficial plan, for laying the first brick of yonder
wings this time twelvemonth, and for the favour of your company on
this our anniversary. Thanks to you, _Mr. President_¹, who have long
been a fellow-helper in this important work, and have now the pleasure
of seeing the fruit of all your labours. Thanks to the _Gentlemen of
his Majesty’s Honourable Council_, and to the _Members of the General
Assembly_, who so warmly recommended the utility of this institution.
Thanks to you, Sir, who first opened it by preaching. Thanks to you,
who left your native country, and without fee and reward have for many
years laboured and watched over us in the LORD. Thanks to all who have
this day honoured us with your presence. And above all, thanks, more
than an orphan tongue can utter, or orphan hearts conceive, be, under
GOD, rendered unto you, most honoured Sir, who have been so happily
instrumental, in the hands of a never-failing GOD, in spreading his
ever-lasting gospel.

                                          SAVANNAH, _March 27, 1771_.

MONDAY last being the anniversary of laying the foundation of the
Orphan-house, the new and very decent chapel lately erected there was
opened. On this solemnity his Excellency the Governor, many of the
Gentlemen of the Council, and a very great number of the principal
inhabitants of the province, were present. The company being seated
in the chapel, and the orphan children having sung a short hymn,
the following address, with great propriety, and to the universal
satisfaction of the audience, was delivered by _Peter Edwards_, one
of the orphans:

  “_May it please your Excellency,
  Reverend Gentlemen,
  Gentlemen and Ladies_,

In obedience to the commands of my superiors, and relying also on
the candour and benevolence of your Excellency and this polite and
respectable company, I beg leave, with all humility, to make this
public address. It may not be improper to mention, that on this
day, thirty-two years ago, the foundation of this house was laid by
the reverend Founder, whose death _we orphans in particular_ cannot
sufficiently lament; that also on this day, two years past, your
Excellency honoured this place with your presence, and condescended to
lay the foundation of the two wings, superadded to the Orphan-house,
for the accommodation of young gentlemen intended to be educated in
academical learning, to enable them to move in a superior sphere of
life; and we are now met to open and solemnly dedicate this new and
convenient chapel to the service of our God and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.
The many and great advantages accruing from the establishment of
public schools in every government, is obvious, and in a young
province, as this is, it must be of the highest importance to its
future prosperity and welfare, which is the professed design of this
charitable institution; an institution evidently calculated to promote
the happiness of society, by providing for, and instructing such poor
children, as would otherwise, in all appearance, be brought up in
ignorance, and become of little use and value to mankind. They are
_here_ early taught their duty to GOD, and their country, and the
respect they owe to those in authority over them. GOD has various,
and to us unthought-of ways, which we poor short-sighted beings cannot
fathom, to effect his purposes; but I hope I may be allowed to say,
that, in all human probability, great might have been the blessing
to this noble undertaking, had it pleased divine Providence to have
prolonged the valuable life of the deceased Founder: but he is now no
more. We have, however, no doubt of the great Father of the fatherless
supplying his loss; and that your Excellency, and all well-disposed
persons, especially the good people of this province, will espouse
our cause, and promote our welfare. Agreeable to the plan of our
deceased Benefactor, an Academy is now _begun_ to be superadded to the
Orphan-house, and gentlemen of this province will have an opportunity
of educating their sons under their immediate inspection, and will
not be under the necessity of sending them at a great distance for
that purpose, or be constantly labouring under the painful anxiety
of knowing of their health and welfare, besides being probably at a
greater and more uncertain expence.

The utility of this, it is humbly presumed, wants no recommendation:
it is natural to love the place where we received our education, and
passed our first years. If parents would therefore have the pleasure
of seeing the daily progress their children make in knowledge; if they
desire they should love and revere them, and have a peculiar regard
for the place of their nativity; if they would preserve them from the
improper liberties they may take, when removed from their authority;
it surely must be most eligible to let them spend their early years
under the shadow of their wings, and within the reach of their parental
admonitions.


_May it please your Excellency_,

I have now in charge to return your Excellency, with all deference and
humility, our most grateful acknowledgments for your kind patronage
and countenance; and to assure your Excellency, that we do and will
constantly pray for your happiness, wherever Providence may please to
place you, unfeignedly wishing, that your Excellency may continually
experience that heart-felt satisfaction which can only dwell in the
breast of the humane and benevolent; and we are persuaded, when you
return to your native country, our cause will not be forgotten by your
Excellency.


_Honourable Sir_,¹

We should be highly wanting in gratitude, if, on this occasion, we
omitted to acknowledge your unwearied and unabating attention to
serve this institution from its first foundation; and we are happy
that GOD has been pleased to preserve _your life_ to succeed our kind
Founder, and carry into execution his truly generous intentions. Your
disinterested regard to promote our real welfare is well known, and
therefore I shall forbear to add, only that for your happiness, and
long continuance amongst us, we daily pray.

    ¹ The Honourable _James Habersham_.


  _Reverend Gentlemen,
  Gentlemen and Ladies_,

Permit me to return you our best thanks for the very kind regard you
have shewn us, and to assure you, that we will endeavour to deserve the
continuance of your friendship and favour.


  _Sir, and Gentlemen_,¹

We cannot, we must not, Sir, omit to give our public testimony of your
unwearied diligence and attention to cultivate and improve our minds
in solid learning and useful knowledge; and, Gentlemen, it would be
unjust, if we did not make the same acknowledgment for your constant
care to make our situation, in regard to our bodies, easy, comfortable,
and every way convenient, and as we have nothing to repay you, but
our prayers for your welfare, both in time and eternity, and our best
thanks, we hope you will kindly accept this tribute of our grateful
hearts.

    ¹ The Tutor and the Managers.


  _Young Gentlemen_, (the Boarders.)

You are happy in having parents, who have both inclination and means
to pay for your education. I have none. But to you, Gentlemen, I must
own my obligation for having the opportunity of an education I could
not, from my situation, have expected, had not your parents enabled our
worthy Executor to employ so able a Tutor, as we now have, to instruct
us, and I hope we shall shew, that his assiduity, care and pains, will
have the desired effect.


  _My fellow Orphans_,

What shall I say to excite your gratitude? I hope the memory of our
late Benefactor, who has laboured incessantly for me, for you, and many
others, who have partaken of the benefit of this institution, since its
first foundation, will be deeply engraven in our hearts, and remembered
with the greatest reverence and gratitude. This is all we have in our
power, in return for such unmerited favours, and if this, our small
tribute, should be wanting, we must, we shall be justly deemed the most
ungrateful to our deceased Benefactor, who encountered innumerable,
uncommon, and unknown difficulties, in carrying on this institution,
notwithstanding he was maligned, traduced, and persecuted, with
unrelenting virulence, as a cheat, an impostor, a public robber, and
as one, who, under the specious pretence of promoting a charitable
design, was amassing great wealth to himself; all which he bore with an
uncommon degree of patience. Let me add, that GOD has been graciously
pleased to provide for you, and for me, beyond many, very many in our
circumstances. We are _here_ daily taught the great and fundamental
truths of the gospel of the Son of GOD, have plenty of the necessaries
of life, and are carefully educated to qualify us to get a comfortable
subsistence, and make us useful members of society. Let us therefore
make a proper improvement of these mercies, and let us, my dear fellow
Orphans, be thankful to GOD, the Father of all, for them, not only
with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to his service,
and by walking before him in holiness and righteousness all our days,
through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.


  _May it please your Excellency,
  Reverend Gentlemen,
  Gentlemen and Ladies_,

I fear I have trespassed on your patience, and humbly entreat you to
pardon the poor attempt of a youth unaccustomed to speak before so
respectable an audience.”

After this the Rev. Mr. _Edward Ellington_, minister of the parish of
_St. Bartholomew_, in _South Carolina_, read prayers, and preached a
sermon very suitable to the occasion, from _Matthew_ xviii. 20. Divine
service being ended, the young gentlemen of the academy repeated
several passages taken from some of the most approved _English_ authors,
in such a manner as appeared agreeably to engage the attention and
to meet with the entire approbation of the company. Then Mr. _Edward
Langworthy_, their Tutor, addressed the company as follows:


  “_May it please your Excellency,
  Gentlemen and Ladies_,

Having observed the attention of your Excellency to the exercises of
this morning, and the marks of pleasure and approbation so visible in
all the Gentlemen and Ladies now present, I think it my duty, with the
warmest gratitude, to acknowledge the honour your Excellency and this
respectable audience have conferred on this institution. The young
gentlemen that just now spoke before your Excellency, have not been
long under my tuition; they are indeed _young_, and scarce initiated
in the first principles of literature; however, I flatter myself that
these feeble attempts will be favourably received, and that hereafter
they will be enabled to exhibit something more worthy of your attention
and approbation.

It affords me the highest satisfaction, when I reflect, that divine
providence hath honoured me with the care and direction of them, and
I cannot but make a tender of my sincere and best respects to you,
our worthy Executor, and to their worthy parents and friends, for the
great confidence reposed in me. Duly sensible of the important trust
committed to every preceptor, I shall, in the fear of GOD, do my utmost
to form their tender minds, and to impress on them such principles
as may tend to advance their happiness in private, as well as in
public life: and I hope, from their proficiency, the Gentlemen of this
province will be induced to promote with all their influence the growth
and prosperity of our present undertaking.

The strict and virtuous education of youth is a point of great
consequence in every country, and those that are employed therein
do certainly merit the attention and encouragement of the public in
proportion to their faithfulness; for my part, I do most chearfully
dedicate my whole time to this laborious work, and am determined to
pursue it with the greatest assiduity and diligence, being convinced
that I can in no other way do more good to the true interest of my
fellow beings, or do more service to the province.

It is undoubtedly the indispensible obligation of every one entrusted
with the business of education, to satisfy the public with respect
to their abilities and intentions, and therefore I hope to convince
you that no pains will be spared, and no time lost, and that whatever
is useful in the sciences, or ornamental in life, will _here_ be
inculcated both by precept and example. Authors in the several
branches of knowledge will be regularly read, and the sacred scriptures
constantly explained: these can bestow understanding upon all men;
they are the universal logic, since none can read them without either
acquiring a greater exactness of thought, or being invited to contract
a greater rectitude of manners.

Our time being so far elapsed, permit me, in the behalf of these poor
Orphans, and in the name of every member concerned in this Seminary,
most heartily to thank your Excellency, and all the Gentlemen and
Ladies now before me, for their kind attendance on this solemnity. With
sentiments of the most unfeigned gratitude we would express our sense
of it, and hope for the continuance of your esteem and friendship.

And I should be greatly wanting in respect and duty to you, Reverend
Sir, and indeed justly incur the displeasure of all concerned in
the management of this institution, if I did not now embrace the
opportunity of returning you their and my humblest thanks for your
kind and friendly assistance.

May what you and others have done on this Anniversary, terminate in the
glory of the great Head of the church, who is GOD over all, blessed for
evermore.”

Between the exercises of the day, the Orphan children sung several
short hymns adapted to the occasion, with one of which the solemnity
was closed. The company were afterward entertained with a plain and
plentiful dinner in the Great Hall, and unanimously expressed their
satisfaction of the proceedings of the day, and especially of the
decency and order with which the whole was conducted.
