    <i>My very dear friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I have had no answer to my last, yet I suppose it hath reached your hands, and I am glad to hear that <a
      id="p003a" href="#n_1">♦</a><i>Ephrata</i>
    plantation is in some degree opened, and thereby a preparation made for a future progress this spring. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Fox</i> not coming, and going upon lumber, hath been a great loss to my poor family, but I hope ere now all is settled, and the sawing carried on with vigour. That seems to be the thing which providence points out at present, and as so many negroes are ready, it will be a pity that <i>Bethesda</i> should not do something, as well as the neighbouring planters. If it was not that I am erecting a large place for public worship, eighty feet square, and am called to preach to so many thousands in various places, I would come over immediately myself. But perhaps it will be best to stay till the new Governor is appointed and embarks, or at least to come a little before him. I hear that Colonel <i>Vanderdison</i> will in all probability be the man; they are determined I find to have a military person. With this, I send your brother a power to dispose of <i>Providence</i> plantation, and I hope to hear shortly that Doctor <i>B――</i>, with your assistance, hath purchased more negroes,—My dear friend, do exert yourself a little for me in this time of my absence, and I trust the Orphan-house affairs will shortly be so ordered, that none
    <a id="p004"></a>shall be troubled about its affairs, but my own domestics. As <i>Nathaniel P――</i> is so willing, and hath hitherto behaved so faithfully, I have sent him a full power in conjunction with <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    to act under you. The man and woman that bring this, are with their son indented to me, and I have an excellent school mistress and a young student, engaged to come over shortly. Ere long, I suppose we shall have a large family. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    grant it may be a religious one! I would have nothing done in respect to the building, besides repairing the piazza, and what else is absolutely necessary, till I come. Perhaps I may bring a carpenter along with me, who will stay some years. I cannot tell what can induce me to take care of a place, where the gospel is so little regarded, unless it be a principle of faith. Surely it will not always be so. What difference is there between <i>Georgia</i>, and several parts of <i>England</i>? Here thousands and ten thousands run, and ride miles upon miles to hear the gospel.—There—but I do not love to think of it. O my dear friend, whatever others do, may you and your houshold serve the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    I see there is no happiness, but in keeping near to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.—But
    this prosperity,—this worldly mindedness,—how many fools hath it destroyed; how many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    own children hath it awfully bewildered! May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    keep all my dear friends clear of this dangerous rock! My love to all. How is <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>V――</i>? Pray do your utmost to bring about a reconciliation between him and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i>. I could give several particular and powerful reasons; at present I can add no more. My dear friend, pray for us, and exert yourself for <i>Bethesda</i>; <i>Bethesda</i>’s <span
      class="smcap">God</span> will richly reward you.</p>
  <p class="align_close">
    Yours most affectionately in our common <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T gives me pain, when any of your Ladyship’s letters lie by me unanswered,—I would always write immediately if I could. For many days I have been much engaged, but can now refrain no longer. Your Ladyship’s letter was immediately forwarded to <i>Philadelphia</i>.—It will be an acceptable present
    <a id="p005"></a>to the good old Governor. I wish <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>T――</i> may not make too great compliances,—but I fear instability is his weak side. I have not heard from <i>South Audley Street</i>, since I wrote last to your Ladyship.—The <i>Moravian</i>’s outward scheme, I am apt to believe will soon be disconcerted. Strange! Why will <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children build <i>Babels</i>? Why will they flatter themselves, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    owns and approves of them, because he suffers them to build high? In mercy to them, such buildings, of whatever kind, must come down. I hope our new-intended tabernacle is not of this nature. It would have pleased your Ladyship, to have seen how willingly the people gave last <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day. At seven in the morning we collected fifty pounds, in the evening one hundred and twenty-six pounds. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we have now near nine hundred pounds in hand. He that hath begun, I trust will enable us to go on, and bring out the top-stone, shouting Grace! Grace! Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    still continues to work in our old despised place. I trust it hath been a <i>Bethel</i> to many, many souls. This your Ladyship knows may be any where. <i>Clifton</i>’s a <i>Bethel</i> when <span

    is there. That your Ladyship may enjoy more and more of the divine presence, and increase with all the increase of <span

Have you the first account you wrote of your conversion? Or have you leisure to draw up a short narrative of the rise and progress of the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in your parts? A dear christian minister in <i>Scotland</i>, is about to publish two volumes, relative to the late awakenings in various places. Such things should be transmitted to posterity; in heaven all will be known. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that there is such a rest remaining for his dear people. I am too impatient to get at it. But who can help longing to see <span

    What but a hope and prospect of furthering his glorious gospel, can reconcile us to this <i>aceldama</i>, this wide howling wilderness? If we had not our beloved to lean on, what should we do? Go on, my dear Sir, in his strength; I wish you much, yea very much prosperity. The <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> THANK you and your brother most heartily for the loan of the chapel. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the work goes on well.—On <i>Thursday</i> morning, the first brick of our new tabernacle was laid with awful solemnity. I preached from <i>Exodus</i> the twentieth, and the latter part of the twenty-fourth verse; “In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee and bless thee.” Afterwards we sung, and prayed for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    blessing in all places, where his glorious name is recorded. The
    <a id="p007"></a>wall is now about a yard high. The building is to be eighty feet square. It is upon the old spot. We have purchased the house, and if we finish what we have begun, shall be rent-free for forty-six years. We have above eleven hundred pounds in hands. This I think is the best way to build. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Steward</i>’s death so affected me, that when I met the workman that night to contract about the building, I could scarce bear to think of building tabernacles. Strange! that so many should be so soon discharged, and we continued! Eighteen years have I been waiting for the coming of the son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    but I find we are immortal till our work is done. O that we may never live to be ministered unto, but to minister! <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Steward</i> spoke for his <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    as long as he could speak at all. He had no clouds nor darkness. I was with him, till a few minutes before he slept in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I have good news from several parts; a door is opening at <i>Winchester</i>. Surely the little leaven will ferment, till the whole kingdom be leavened. Even so, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    Amen! Pray how does our elect Lady? I hope to write to her Ladyship next post. Joint love attends you and yours, and your brother and his houshold.—That all may increase with all the increase of <span

    <i>W――</i>s are agreed, as the younger brother writes me word, in answer to my letter. Let brotherly love continue! I do not
    <a id="p008"></a>like writing against any body, but I think, that wisdom which dwells with prudence, should direct you not to fill <abbr

    <i>W――s</i> people (who expect you will serve them) with needless jealousies. He that believeth doth not make haste.—I therefore wait, being assured of this, that every plant which our heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted out. I hope to see the time, when you will talk less of persons and things, and more of Him, who is the common head of his whole mystical body. This, and this alone can make and keep you steady in yourself, and extensively useful to others. I am glad you know when persons are justified. It is a lesson I have not yet learnt. There are so many stony-ground hearers that receive the word with joy, that I have determined to suspend my judgment, till I know the tree by its fruits. You will excuse this freedom. I love you with a disinterested love, I only wish you may be happy in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    This will make you see things with new eyes, and give you such a freedom of heart as is unspeakable, and full of glory. For the present I must bid you adieu. That the <span

I know your prayers will not be wanting. I am glad you have found out another thief, that lay hid in the chambers of imagery, which are in your heart. Time and temptation will draw out ten thousand more, which as yet, you know nothing of. Happy they, who can discover, pluck out, and cut off their right hand and right eye corruptions. This must be done, or we shall only take up with the bare semblance of holiness. The Redeemer must sit as a refiner’s fire upon our hearts, or we shall never be purified as gold or silver. This is our comfort, when we are tried we shall come forth like gold. The offences that we meet with in the church,

    <i>G――</i>, as well as yourself, may learn experience from what hath happened, and never run yourselves into needless difficulties. What is happening to the <i>Moravians</i> is no more than I have long expected, and spoken of to many friends. Their scheme is so <i>antichristian</i> in almost every respect, that I am amazed the eyes of the <i>English</i> brethren have not long since been opened, and the <i>Babel</i> stopt at the first. But the glorious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    generally suffers such buildings to go high, that their fall may be more conspicuous. May the builders rise (I mean as to spirituals) by their falls, and gain by their losses! That is all the harm I wish them. My dear man, what a blessed thing it is to live and walk in the simplicity of the gospel! How happy is that man, who being neither fond of money, numbers, nor power, goes on day by day without any other scheme, than a general intention to promote the common salvation amongst people of all denominations. Will you pray that I may be thus minded? I cease not to pray for you and yours, and my other dear friends at <i>Leeds</i>; and I would set out immediately for the north, was I not obliged to be here in about two months, to attend and give further orders about our building. But some time in the summer—What?—I hope to see the fields white, ready unto harvest again, and to rejoice together with you in our common <span

    the mean while, let us be busy for so blessed a Master, and be continually pressing forward towards the mark for the prize of our high calling. The <span

I trust that his people every where will be made to sing, “The Winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.” All things promise well at <i>London</i>; and I hope you will yet see greater things than ever in the <i>North</i>. Some time this Summer I hope to see you all again. In the mean while, you must not fail to pray for me. I must now begin to enter upon my Spring circuit. For these three days past, I have been preaching here twice a-day. In the mornings we have been quiet, but in the evenings the sons of <i>Belial</i> have been somewhat rude. The place built here for public worship, is much larger than yours at <i>Newcastle</i>; and, I believe, hundreds of truly awakened souls attend. What cannot <span

    do? What will the end of this be? The destruction of <i>Jericho</i>.—The rams-horns must go round, till her tow’ring walls fall down. Who would but be one of these rams-horns? My dear Sir, let us not be ashamed of the cross of <span

    it is lined with love, and will ere long be exchanged for a crown. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    himself will put it on our heads. I am called away, and therefore cannot enlarge. To-morrow, <span

    At present I am engaged in a very ungrateful work; I mean, in writing against the leading <i>Moravian</i> brethren.

I fear the third part of the Journals cannot be procured: perhaps it is not much matter. I am sick of all I do, and stand astonished that the Redeemer still continues to make use of and bless me. Surely I am more foolish than any man; no one receives so much, and does so little. If you was here, we would weep together: friends know what it is to exchange hearts. May the common friend of sinners keep both our hearts near himself, and then all will be well. I cannot think of <i>Leeds</i> without weeping.

    “Brethren, pray for us,” is still the earnest request of my poor heart. I am weaker than the weakest, less than the least of all. Write
    <a id="p013"></a>to me; I do not like your sending such round-about ways: friends letters always pay postage.

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH my wife hath not sent me the letter, yet she writes me, “That you have sent me a threatening one.” I thank you for it, though unseen, and say unto thee, if thou art thus minded, “What thou doest, do quickly.” Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am ready to receive the most traiterous blow, and to confess before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man, all my weaknesses and failings, whether in public or private life. I laid my account of such treatment, before I published my expostulatory letter.—And your writing in such a manner, convinces me more and more, that <i>Moravianism</i> leads us to break through the most sacred ties of nature, friendship, and disinterested love. But my wife says you write, “That <i>I am drunk with power and approbation</i>.” Wast thou with me so long, my dear man, and hast thou known me no better? What power didst thou know me ever to grasp at? Or what power am I now invested with? None, that I know of, except that of being a poor pilgrim. And as for approbation, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows, I have had little else besides the cross to glory in, since my first setting out.—May that be my glory still! But my wife says you write, “That I promised not to print.” I remember no such thing. I know you advised me not to do so, but I know of no promise made. If I remember, I had not then read <i>Rimius</i>; but after that, I both heard and saw so many things, that I could not, with a safe conscience, be silent. My wife says likewise, that you write, “The bulk of my letter is not
    <a id="p014"></a>truth.” So says <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Peter B――</i>; nay, he says, “that all is a lie:” and I hear he declares so in the pulpit. So that whether I will or not, he obliges me to clear myself in print; and if he goes on in this manner, will not only constrain me to print a third edition, but also to publish the dreadful heap that lies behind. My answers to him, the Count, and my old friend <i>H――</i>, are almost ready. I cannot send them this post, but may have time ere long. O my dear man, let me tell thee, that the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of truth and love hates lies: and that cause can never be good, which needs equivocations and falshoods to support it. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall have none from me. I have naked truth. I write out of pure love: and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    only knows, what unspeakable grief and pain I feel, when I think how many of my dear friends have so involved themselves. If any thing stops my pen, it will be concern for them, not myself. I value neither name, nor life itself, when the cause of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    calls me to venture both. Thanks be to his great name, I can truly say, that for these many years last past, no sin hath had dominion over me; neither have I slept with the guilt of any known, unrepented sin lying upon my heart: if you will tell me of any, I will be obliged to you. In the mean while, I wish thee well in body and soul, and subscribe myself, my dear <i>John</i>,</p>

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    I hope this will find you (like the impression of my seal) with your soul winged for heaven, and this poor, earthly, good-for-nothing world, under your feet. Could I fly away, you should never see me till we meet at the right hand of <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS glad, at my return from a late excursion, to find a letter from you, especially as it bespoke your heart to be nearer than usual to the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    May this intimacy increase daily, and the fruits of it appear in your abounding in every good word and work! I find more and more, that one’s whole life ought to be a continued sacrifice of love. I am glad <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>R――</i> is owned. This gives me hopes, that he begins to preach as when he first set out, and as he told a friend, a little before his embarking, “that he hoped he should.” It never went better with his heart than then. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    keep him and all from further entanglements by fleshly wisdom and worldly policy! which I think have nothing to do with the work of the <span

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>S――</i> can tell you what concern the <i>B――n</i>’s awful conduct hath given me. Surely if the Redeemer had not supported me, I should within these two months have died with grief. But I will say no more:—<span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    knows all things. He will not long bear with guile. You know my temper. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> help me in simplicity and
    <a id="p016"></a>godly sincerity to have my conversation in the world, and in the church! By this time twelvemonth (if in the land of the dying) I hope to see you. In the mean while, let <abbr

    <i>S――</i> speak. I hope he hath succeeded to his wishes; and I pray earnestly that the <span

    of the seas and of the dry land, may bring him safe to the desired haven. Ere long we shall all arrive, I trust, in <i>Abraham</i>’s harbour; from thence we shall never put out to sea any more. There the wicked world, and even <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    own children, will cease from troubling, and our weary souls enjoy an everlasting rest. May you and yours enter with a full gale! Let us write to, though we cannot as yet see each other. Our hearty love and respects await <abbr

    <i>W――</i>’s are very friendly. I like them, because they go out and let the world see what they are at once; I suspect something wrong, when so much secrecy is required. But I must have done. Only let me tell you, that the Redeemer still owns my feeble labours. I have been a circuit of about 700 miles, and preached to many thousands. My body yet is upheld, and my soul rejoices in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    my Saviour. Help me, help me to praise him. I thank you for what you have done for <abbr

As I lead a pilgrim life, have a weak body, and am almost continually surrounded with a variety of trials and temptations, I cannot write so frequently as I otherwise would choose to do.

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to such a wretch as I am, is unspeakable. I will inform you of a little. After leaving <i>Leicester</i>, I went to <i>Nottingham</i>, where a great multitude came to hear, and I trust good was done, though a son of <i>Belial</i> endeavoured to disturb us. From thence I went to <i>Sheffield</i>, where we had two good meetings. The congregation in the afternoon consisted of several thousands. Here some dear friends from <i>Leeds</i> met me, two of which were my spiritual children, and all had been blessed under the word. The next morning we set out for <i>Leeds</i>, and in our way preached at <i>Rotheram</i> and <i>Wakefield</i>. At the former place, I had been disturbed twice or thrice, and was almost determined to preach there no more. But we are poor judges. A person told me, <a
      id="p021a" href="#n_4">♦</a>“That <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had made me instrumental in converting his wife and brother,” who had both been bitter persecutors, but now gladly received me under their roof. After preaching, a young man was set at liberty, who had been groaning under the spirit of bondage four years; and whilst I was baptizing a child, the Holy Spirit was pleased to baptize several, one in particular with a holy fire. What we saw, and felt, and heard at <i>Leeds</i>, cannot well be expressed. Thousands attended daily; and on the Lord’s-day it was computed that near twenty thousand heard at once. I preached thrice, and the next day at <a
      id="p021b" href="#n_5">♠</a><i>Burstall</i>
    and <i>Bradford</i>, where many thousands flocked also. Many were filled as with new wine; and as for myself, I scarce knew whether I was in heaven or on earth. On <i>Tuesday</i> morning, though we had drank plentifully before, yet our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    kept the good wine till the last. We had a glorious parting-blessing. At <i>York</i> I preached four times. Twice we were disturbed, and twice we had sweet seasons. There is a good work begun there. The prospect all around is so glorious, I almost repent that I have engaged to go to
    <a id="p022"></a><i>Scotland</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall come back as fast as possible. What a pity is it that I have but one body, and that a very weak one too. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    magnify thy strength in my weakness, and send me where thou wilt. Here I am most kindly received. How the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will be pleased to deal with me, you may know hereafter. I can now only entreat the continuance of the prayers of you and yours; and with repeated thanks for repeated favours, beg leave to subscribe myself, my very dear friend,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> WROTE to your Ladyship just before I set out for <i>Portsmouth</i>, and thought to have written again at my return, but was hindered by staying only one night at <i>London</i>. Ever since I have been upon the range for lost sinners, and blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    have been much owned by him who delights to work by the meanest instruments. In <i>Northamptonshire</i> our cup ran over. In <i>Leicester</i>, the Redeemer caused us to triumph; and in <i>Yorkshire</i>, at <i>Leeds</i> and the adjacent places, I have sometimes scarce known whether I have been in heaven or earth. I have been enabled to preach thrice a day, and once at <i>Leeds</i>, perhaps to near twenty thousand, as they were computed. Indeed we kept holy-day there. Many came to me that were awakened at my former visits. Not unto me, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    not unto me, but unto thy free and unmerited mercy be all the glory! In my way hither I preached four times at <i>York</i>; twice we were disturbed, and twice all was quiet; and a sweet influence attended the word. I lodged at <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>G――</i>’s, who keeps steady. She enquired most heartily after your Ladyship, and begged to be remembered in the most respectful manner. Hither I came on <i>Saturday</i>, and have preached seven times, and once at <i>Sunderland</i>, where a great multitude attended, and were deeply impressed. At five in the morning the great room is filled, and on Lord’s-day the congregation without was great indeed. Surely the shout of a king hath been amongst us. All is harmony and
    <a id="p023"></a>love. I am now going to a place called <i>Sheep-hill</i>, and shall return in the evening to preach here again. To-morrow, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I set forwards to <i>Scotland</i>. I could almost wish this was to be the end of my circuit, for I want to go to various parts. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    magnify thy strength in my weakness, and send me where thou wilt! If your Ladyship pleases, this may be communicated to <i>C―― W――</i>, to whom I would write if I had time. I can only now entreat the continuance of your Ladyship’s prayers, and beg your Ladyship’s acceptance of repeated acknowledgments for repeated favours, from, ever-honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OURS I just now received, but know not what to say by way of answer. The inward discouragements I have felt for above a week, against coming to <i>Scotland</i>, have been very many. I have left a people full of fire. Thousands and thousands flocked to hear the glorious gospel. Awakenings I have heard of in every place; saints have been revived, and heaven as it were come down on earth. We have enjoyed perpetual <i>Cambuslang</i> seasons. My eyes gush out with tears of joy, (and I trust at the same time with godly sorrow for my vileness) at the very thought of it. My heart is quite broken, to think poor <i>Scotland</i> is so dead. O how gloomy hath been the aspect! I have been afraid of catching cold, though, alas! I am too too cold towards Him, who out of warm love bled and died for me. O that <i>Glasgow</i> friends, if I do come, may pray for me! I could scarce believe your letter, that your people would be glad to see such an ill and hell-deserving, good for nothing creature as I am. If I lose the opportunity of seeing you, I shall be disappointed indeed. I believe I shall keep to the time proposed. O time, time, how slowly dost thou go on! When shall I be wafted to an happy eternity? Often within these three weeks have I hoped to die in the embraces of
    <a id="p024"></a>my <span class="smcap">God</span>. Had I a thousand souls and bodies they should be all <i>itinerants</i> for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I want to see all on a flame of fire. You know, dear Sir, what fire I mean. O! break heart strings, break, and let the imprisoned soul be set at liberty. I want to go where I shall neither sin myself, nor see others sin any more. My tender love to all. I can no more for weeping. When I forget to pray for my ungrateful vile self,—then will my worthy and dear friend cease to be remembered by, reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

But above all, am I humbled and comforted at the good news from <i>Leeds</i>, and <i>York</i>. And will the high and lofty one then continue to delight to honour such a wretch as I am? Then, through the divine strength, let me now begin to preach more than ever. Yesterday I was enabled to preach five times, and I suppose the last time to near twenty thousand, and almost to as many in the morning. People flock and are more fond than ever to hear; at <i>Edinburgh</i> also, I preached twice every day to many thousands; among whom are many of the noble and polite.—Attention sits upon the faces of all, and friends come

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> WOULD have answered your kind letter before I left <i>Edinburgh</i>, but I had not a moment’s leisure. With great difficulty I got away, after a heart-breaking parting on <i>Tuesday</i> about noon. On <i>Wednesday</i> evening, and the <i>Thursday</i> morning, I preached at <i>Berwick</i>, and on <i>Thursday</i> evening at <i>Alnwick</i>, in the street. It being the time of the races, I discoursed on these words, “So run that ye may obtain.” Whilst I was discoursing, the gentlemen came down from the race, and surrounded the congregation, and heard very attentively. The next morning at five I preached again, and about noon at a place called <i>Placy</i>, and in the evening about nine at <i>Newcastle</i>, where a great number expected me. My text was “At midnight a cry was made, behold the bridegroom cometh.” The next morning I received the following note, “Dearly beloved in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I write to you good news. Your labour was not in vain last night, for my wife answered to the midnight cry, and received <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    into her soul.” O that we may all praise the Three in One! Last night I prepared for, and this morning I opened the gospel fair from these words, “Ho! every one that thirsteth.” Much of the divine presence was in the congregation, and I believe many tasted of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    wine. I am to preach three times almost
    <a id="p026"></a>every day this week. This promise supports me. “As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.” By the inclosed, you will see the devil owes me a grudge for what was done at <i>Glasgow</i>. Would it not be proper to insert a paragraph to contradict it? Thousands and thousands come to hear notwithstanding. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what am I? A poor hell-deserving creature; and yet the <span

    makes use of such to thresh the mountains with. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    help me so to do, and then let him deal with me as seemeth good in his sight. Please to remember us in the kindest manner to dear <abbr

    prosper this, and every other work of your hands upon you! My lot is to be a pilgrim, a run-about for <span

Since my last, I have been travelling and preaching twice or thrice, and once five times a day. I cannot tell your Ladyship of one thousandth part of what we have seen and felt. In <i>Scotland</i> the congregations were larger than ever. At <i>Glasgow</i>, the man who owned the playhouse was made so uneasy by the word preached, that he took down the roof himself. For this Satan owes me a grudge, and therefore it is put in the paper, that a mob was raised. But there was not the least appearance of any such thing. Our weapons are not carnal, but mighty through <span

    Glory be to free grace, I find the happiness of the divine life an increasing happiness indeed.—Lately our common <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is now near eleven at night, and I am to ride beyond <i>Coventry</i> to-morrow: but I cannot close my eyes without sending you a short account of my week’s work. On <i>Saturday</i> last, I preached at <i>Oulney</i>, and had a blessed season. On the Lord’s day we had two glorious opportunities in this place, where the congregations were much larger than before. On <i>Monday</i> I went to <i>Oxen</i> near <i>Harborough</i>; it was their feast-day, but if I mistake not, some of their feasting was spoiled. In the evening I preached at <i>Bosworth</i>; the congregation was large as well as that at <i>Oxen</i>, and the power as great. About nine at night I got to <i>Kettering</i>, where I preached the next morning to many souls; the Redeemer gave us a spiritual breakfast. About five in the evening I reached <i>Bedford</i>, and preached in the <i>Green</i> last night, and this morning. This afternoon we had another blessed season at <i>Oulney</i>, and this evening I sojourn here, in order to set out for <i>Birmingham</i> to-morrow. A new scene of usefulness hath opened this week. O that nothing may retard me in my pilgrim life! It is worse than death to me, to be stopt in that. You, my dear Sir, are called to trade, I to travel for my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Whilst trading, you are in effect travelling and preaching to thousands; for you greatly strengthen my hands in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Great shall be your reward in heaven. O what a bountiful master do we serve! I am loath to go to sleep, and yet this vile body stands in need of it. My dear, very dear Sir, good night. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

I am reposing the utmost confidence in you and yours. You are going to assist in a house, built in answer to millions of prayers, and which I doubt not, will prove a blessing to many that are now unborn. Look upon it in this light; think of the honour <span

You need not ask any prayers, they will follow after you, though you should even fly upon the wings of the wind. I have pawned my word for your good behaviour in every respect, and hope to have my most sanguine expectations answered. Get but humility, and all will be well. I am satisfied about your passage and your room. You will remember, that <span

    <a id="p034"></a>doves to the windows. At a place near <i>Dudley</i>, called <i>Guarnall</i>, I heard of a whole company awakened by reading my poor sermons. I met with others awakened years ago; and at one place, an old saint said, “this is the old story fifty-five years ago.” Another near as old, said, “I was comforted when you came last, now <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath sent you to me again, and I can go more chearful to heaven.” I have heard of a great reprobate, a notorious persecutor and drunkard, who hath been struck most powerfully. O my dear Sir; what shall you have for helping me in outward things, assisting me by your prayers, and thereby causing me to press forward more chearfully in this delightful work of publishing the everlasting gospel!

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    hath vouchsafed to employ me in breaking up new ground. I have preached four times at <i>Alperam</i> in <i>Cheshire</i>, where the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was with us of a truth, and where he had sweetly prepared my way, by blessing several of my poor writings. At <i>Chester</i> I preached four times; a great concourse attended; all was hushed and quiet, several of the clergy were present, and the word came with power. I have since heard, that the most noted rebel in town, was brought under deep conviction, and could not sleep night or day. Within doors, where I preached early in the morning, conviction seemed to go through the whole congregation. At <i>Liverpool</i>, the way was equally prepared.—A person
    <a id="p035"></a>who had been wrought on by some of my printed sermons, met me at landing, and took me to his house; a great number at a short notice was convened; all was quiet here also. Some came under immediate conviction; and I could wish to have stayed much longer, but notice was given for my preaching at <i>Wrexham</i>, which I find since, hath been a rude place indeed. Upon my coming, the town was alarmed, and several thousands came to hear. Several of the baser sort made a great noise, and threw stones, but none touched me, and I trust I can say, our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    got himself the victory. The next day, near <i>Alperam</i>, we had another heaven upon earth. A divine power descended among the people, and we could say, how awfully sweet is this place! The next morning I intended to preach near <i>Nantwich</i>, where a Methodist meeting-house hath lately been pulled down. Here Satan roared.—The mob pelted <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>D――</i> and others much, but I got off pretty free, and had opportunity of preaching quietly a little out of town. Last night I preached here in the dark, to a great body of hearers, for this country, and am now bound for <i>Wednesbury</i>, <i>Dudley</i> and <i>Kidderminster</i>. From thence, perhaps I may come to <i>London</i> for a few days. But this as yet is not determined. You will either see or hear again from me soon.

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave us richly to feast upon his great love. At <i>Painswick</i> we had two pleasant seasons, and the same favour was vouchsafed us at <i>Chafford</i> and <i>Tedbury</i>. At <i>Gloucester</i> also a time of refreshing came from the presence of the <span

    and the dear Alderman’s house was made a <i>Bethel</i> to my soul. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    brought me here on <i>Monday</i> evening, and to my great disappointment
    <a id="p040"></a>the new tabernacle is not finished, so that I know not well what to do. However, we had a good time last night at the hall, and I hope all this is but the beginning of a warm winter. I am glad that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    deals so bountifully with you at <i>London</i>. May he do so more and more! I believe he will. Your motion to go to <i>Norwich</i> I much approve of. Whatever others design, that is nothing to us. Simplicity and godly sincerity will carry all before it in the end. O that the sons of <i>Zeruiah</i> could be persuaded to let us alone! But how then should we be able to approve ourselves sons of <i>David</i>? By thorns and briars, the old man must be scratched to death.—O this crucifixion work! <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    help us to go through it! He will, he will. I commend thee and thine to his almighty protection and never-failing mercy, as being, my very dear man,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS hath been a long fortnight, for so long it is since I wrote to my very dear friend; but I waited to send him a bundle of good news together. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am not disappointed of my hope. Since my last, I have preached several times in <i>Gloucestershire</i>, where the people, as well as the unworthy preacher, drank plentifully of the good wine of the kingdom. In the fields several thousands attended. Here we have also enjoyed much of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    twice I preached in my brother’s great house to the quality, amongst whom was one of <i>Cæsar</i>’s houshold. On <i>Sunday</i> I opened the new Tabernacle. It is large, but not half large enough: would the place contain them, I believe near as many would attend as in <i>London</i>. Last <i>Monday</i> I set out for <i>Somersetshire</i>, intending to have gone as far as <i>Plymouth</i>, but the weather was so violent, and my call to <i>London</i> likely to be so speedy, that I turned back. However, I preached in <i>Somersetshire</i> four or five times. Some told me, they were scarce able to stand under what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gave them. On <i>Tuesday</i>, at seven in the evening, I preached in the open air to a great multitude; all was hush’d and exceeding solemn; the stars shone exceeding bright, and then, if ever, by an eye of faith, I saw him who calleth them all by their names. My soul was filled with an holy ambition, and I longed to be one of those who shall shine as the stars for ever and ever. My hands and body at this, and at other times were pierced with cold; but what are outward things when the soul within is warmed with the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    O my very dear Sir, increase my obligations by continuing to pray, that
    <a id="p042"></a>this unspeakable gift may be shed abroad abundantly in my heart by the Holy Ghost. Then shall I not grovel as I do now here below, but mount on wings like an eagle; I shall walk and not be weary, I shall hold on and not be faint. O that I may die in the field! But die when or where I will, I shall die under the strongest obligations to you and your dear yoke-fellow, who will both know, at the day of judgment, how sincerely I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

    I was not disappointed. The heart was soaring aloft, mounting on the wings of faith and love, and had fled out of sight of this poor and troublesome world. Thus may that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who is rich in mercy, pay and reward all that love ill and hell-deserving me! The devil himself dares <a

    I rejoice in the promising prospect of the happiness of your brother’s houshold. May it widen and spread over all! If I have any time, I hope to send him a few lines. <span

    hasten the time when my poor kinsmen and brethren after the flesh shall be joined to thee by one spirit! Till then, help me, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    to be continually crying out, “Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why me?” Well may distinguishing grace, and the thoughts of everlasting love, swallow up your whole soul. Strange! that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children should not know their own bread. But these corrupt hearts of ours still verge towards the law. Grace,
    <a id="p043"></a>omnipotent grace alone, can enable us to see our compleatness in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and yet excite us, from principles of gratitude and love, to faithfulness and zeal, as though we were to be saved entirely by them. Glorious mystery! Like the blessed angels, may you and yours, my dear friend, be continually employed in looking into it! This is what I have been preaching on last week in <i>Somersetshire</i>. The fire there warmed and enflamed me, though I preached in the air on <i>Tuesday</i> evening at seven o’clock, as well as on <i>Wednesday</i> and <i>Thursday</i>. I purposed to go as far as <i>Plymouth</i>, but providence hath brought me back, and I am now hastening to <i>London</i>, to pay my last respects to my dying friend. It may be, that shortly <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>J―― W――</i> will be no more; the physicians think his disease is a galloping consumption. I pity the church, I pity myself, but not him. We must stay behind in this cold climate, whilst he takes his flight to a radiant throne, prepared for him from the foundations of the world. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    if it be thy blessed will, let not thy chariot wheels be long in coming. Even so come <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, come quickly! Poor <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>C――</i> will now have double work. But we can do all things through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    strengthening us. The residue of the Spirit is in the Redeemer’s hands, and he hath promised not to leave his people comfortless. Our eyes, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    are unto thee from whom cometh all our salvation. Here I could enlarge, but I must send a few lines to <i>London</i>, which I hope to reach myself some time this week. Be pleased to direct your next there. My <i>Leeds</i> friends have my cordial acknowledgements for their kind enquiries concerning me. I hope this will find them all, with your dear yoke-fellow, leaning on the Mediator’s bosom. There am I now reclining my weary head. Adieu. The <span

    Whatever some may boast of, I know not; but this I can say, that although, through rich, free, and sovereign grace, I have been enabled these nineteen years to say unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    “Thou art my father,” yet I can still say to corruption, “Thou art my sister.” Time and experience will convince others also of this important truth. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    keep me, and all concerned with me, from such manifestations, as do not lead us more and more into the chambers of imagery, which are latent and undiscovered in the secret corners of our hearts! Such only come from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>:
    illuminations which engender pride, and lead us from a deep and pungent feeling of our own nothingness, and the remainders of in-dwelling corruption, are either of a diabolical extraction, or at least are perverted by the devil and proud nature, to feed that disease, which when operating in a genuine way, they have a native tendency to remove. Well might <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Fleming</i> say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, grant me a divine manifestation,
    <a id="p047"></a>but O teach me to manage it after thou hast granted it.” <i>Paul</i> needed a thorn to teach him how to manage such favours aright. I tremble for those who hug their delusions, and look upon the dunghill of corruption as quite removed, when it is only covered over as it were with a little snow. How white did the most foul places look only a few days ago! But the thaw is come, the whiteness is vanished, and filthy dunghills are dunghills still. My dear friend knows how to make the application. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for leading you into the knowledge of the mystery of gospel holiness.—Holiness, not built on <i>Moses</i>, or the sandy bottom of our own faithfulness, but on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    that rock of ages, whose faithfulness makes us faithful, and a reliance on whole compleat and all-sufficient righteousness, doings, and sufferings, carries the believer on (without thinking of a reward) to do and suffer, what a legal heart will shrink and boggle at. May this mind be in you and me, and all that love our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity! When the Son of Man makes them thus free, then will they be free indeed. You may easily see, that part of your letter hath led me insensibly into this strain of writing. If it pleases or profits, or both, it will answer the end designed, and the dear, ever-dear, ever-loving, and ever-lovely Redeemer shall have all the glory. As our acquaintance was begun in him, and I trust hath hitherto been blessed, so I would have it continue to run in the same channel, and, whether absent from or present with each other, sweetly lead us to our ocean, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am only sorry you have such an unprofitable correspondent. Tears are ready to gush out at the thought, and I am ready to sink into the earth, when I consider how little I can do for that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whom I love for himself, or for my friends, whom I love for his great name’s sake. Friend of sinners, circle me in thy own compleat and all-sufficient Self! Good night, my dear Sir, good night. If you guess at my present frame, you will know at whose cross this leaves me, and how much I am</p>

    may never discard me from this divine employ! An itinerant pilgrim life is that which I choose.—And why? It was the life of my blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I hope you will not fail of calling out dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Z――y</i> to it every year.—I am sure <i>America</i>, dear <i>America</i> stands much in need of it. Let envious, lukewarm elder brethren say what they please against it, this is the way that <span
      class="smcap">God</span> hath honoured, yea and I
    <a id="p049"></a>believe will honour even unto the end. But I find, love of honour, power, ease, and fulness of bread, make even good people to think, and speak, and act unlike themselves. These, these are the things which have led the <i>Moravian</i> brethren on this side the water, from the cross of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and made them to differ as much from what once they were, as light from darkness. O how have my dear spiritual children, (for whom I travailed in birth, and whom I love as my own soul) been insensibly led away, and robbed of their spiritual and temporal substance, at least for a while, by some self-designing and deceitful men. Against these, and not the dear people, who have been eaten up as bread, with a bleeding heart, have I drawn my pen; and I believe shall rejoice that I have done so to my dying day. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    grant that the like scene may never be opened on your side the water! But I forbear.—O for heaven! O for that time when we shall get out of this church militant! I long to be</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE mail not coming in regularly, your Ladyship’s letter did not reach me till <i>Thursday</i> afternoon. Yesterday morning I obeyed your Ladyship’s commands, and carried the inclosed to <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>G――</i>, at <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>James</i>’s palace. I was much satisfied with my visit, and am much rejoiced to find, that she seems resolved to show out at once. The court, I believe, rings of her, and if she stands, I trust she will make a glorious martyr for her blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    O that your Ladyship could see your way clear to come up! Now seems to be the time for a fresh stir. Few have either courage or conduct to head a christian party amongst persons of high life. That honour seems to be put upon your Ladyship:—and a glorious honour indeed it is. Till <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>G――</i> can meet with company that is really in earnest, I think the closer she keeps to her <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and her book, the better. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    strengthen, stablish, and settle her in his ways and will! I am yet kept in suspence about <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>W――y</i>; and have been much concerned, lest by intense sympathy, your Ladyship should contract an illness yourself. But your Ladyship hath long since learnt, that as your day is, so shall your strength be. I pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords to lengthen out your important life, and make your Ladyship ten thousand times more useful than ever, long after my worthless head is laid in the silent grave. If I should live to see my dear brother truly converted unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    O how would it delight me! The distant prospect is so pleasing, that I could scarce contain myself at the news of it. I hope to hear from him soon, having written to him lately. On <i>Tuesday</i> I am to dine with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>J―― W――</i>, who was yesterday for a few minutes at the Foundery: but I hear his lungs are touched. I cannot wish him to survive his usefulness. It is poor living to be nursed. But our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    knows what is best for his children. I wish I might have the use of <i>Weststreet</i> chapel once or twice a week; many want to hear at that end of the town: the <abbr

    that you are determined to shew out at once, and to let all know, that you are determined not so much as to attempt to compromise matters between <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and the world. One might as well attempt to reconcile light and darkness, heaven and hell. Happy they who set out on a disinterested bottom; it is the foundation which our great High-priest hath laid, and is a rock that will never fail. Never fear, Madam, though storms and billows, afflictions and temptations abide you; he that enabled the three children to pass unhurt through the fiery furnace, and kept his beloved <i>Daniel</i> from being devoured in a den of lions, can and will preserve you unspotted and undefiled, though surrounded on every side. My poor worthless prayers shall not be wanting for you night and day. Look up, dear Madam, determine to know nothing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    and him crucified, and he will make your very enemies to be at peace with you. But faith must be tried, and grace, when given, must be kept in exercise. Welcome, welcome dear Madam, into the glorious kingdom of the children of <span

    O that all of <i>Cæsar</i>’s houshold were in the same situation! How would they exult

Her Ladyship is a mother in <i>Israel</i> indeed, a mirror of piety, detached from worldly hopes and worldly fears, and therefore no wonder that she so simply copies after her great Exemplar, and glories only in his blessed cross. Till you can find some like-minded, I believe you will find your <span

I heartily wish, that the kind and generous Justice who hath so laudably exerted himself, may have courage to proceed in a due execution of the laws, and I doubt not but the issue will be, that you will have peace. In the mean while, may the Redeemer enable you and all concerned to possess their souls in patience! I think the storm is too violent

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> DOUBT not but the receipt of this will fill you with surprize; yet I hope it will be a pleasing one. Last night after preaching, your son, who hath been lately confined, came to me and gave me a particular detail of his seemingly unhappy circumstances.—The narration affected me, and I asked him to stay supper; the company then with me I thought was what he wanted.—The consequence was, that he went home rejoicing in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    temptations subsided. I cannot help thinking, but that if he conversed with proper persons who knew his case, he might yet come forth as gold tried in the fire. His experience is somewhat uncommon, and perhaps when sufficiently humbled, the glorious Redeemer may exalt him. Satan hath certainly desired to have him to sift him as wheat; but I verily believe <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath prayed for him, and therefore his faith shall not fail. As I know what unspeakable concern, tender parents must necessarily undergo for a child in such a

    <i>My dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> W――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter much affected as well as surprized me.—I may say of it as <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr>
    <i>G――</i> says of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>’s epistle to the <i>Ephesians</i>, “It smelt of the prison.” Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    thoughts are not as our thoughts, neither are his ways as our ways. How amazingly does he over-rule all things, for the spiritual and eternal good of those who love him in sincerity! Through his gracious and never-failing care, out of the eater cometh forth meat, and out of the strongest trial cometh forth unspeakable, spiritual sweetness. If this be the effect of affliction, then may the believer boldly say,</p>
  <p class="quobrk align_ctr txt_sm">
    <i>All hail reproach, and welcome pain!</i></p>
  <p class="quobrk in_00">
    Surely you may sing,</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">

      <p>―― O happy rod,</p>
      <p>Which brought me nearer to my <span

  <p class="in_00">
    Now will you prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to be yours, now, will you find that your very enemies shall be at peace with you;
    <a id="p058"></a>ravens shall feed you, and the bread which you cast upon the waters many days ago, shall now happily be found. I sympathize most sincerely with your dear yoke-fellow, and parent. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we have a rich Saviour to go to.—A Saviour, who though infinitely rich in himself, yet for our sakes became poor. Rejoice then, my dear friend, for having an opportunity of being conformed to him. And whether your affliction be brought on you by any imprudent conduct, or by the immediate hand of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    cast not off I pray you your confidence in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    He is a compassionate high-priest. Perhaps this year, if we should live to the fall, we may have an opportunity of conversing about him face to face. In the mean while, let us pray for each other, and wait for that blessed time, when we shall be afflicted and tossed no more. I meet with my share of trials; but with thankfulness would I set up my <i>Ebenezer</i>; for hitherto my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath helped me. Glory be to his great name, his word runs and is glorified more and more. The wilderness in various places blossoms like a rose. May the <span

    <i>T――</i> and <i>D――</i>, whose work I pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords to bless and prosper. Was Lady <i>H――n</i> in town, they should have been introduced before now, but at present she is at <i>Bath</i> drinking of the waters of life freely, and communicating them freely to others. One of <i>Cæsar</i>’s houshold hath been lately awakened through her Ladyship’s instrumentality, and I hope others will meet with like blessing.
    <a id="p059"></a>Amongst the common people the gospel also runs, and is glorified in divers places. Our new tabernacle the Redeemer vouchsafes to fill with his presence, and gives us daily to hear that delightful music, “The triumphs of his word.” Winter quarters are made pleasant to me, but I long for my Spring campaign.—Perhaps it may be a <i>Spring Voyage</i>.—For I am now seriously thinking of a voyage to <i>America</i>, and live in hopes of seeing your Excellency once more on this side eternity. <span

You sailed only a day or two before I came there myself. However, I am glad to hear that you are safe arrived. May it be an earnest of your arriving ere long in the kingdom of heaven! Perhaps we may meet this Summer. I hope we shall see each other grown in

      class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    You and I are much indebted to him. We have not a moment of time to lose. We ought to be continually saying, “What shall we render unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?”
    O for zeal! O for activity in his glorious service! A crucified <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>! An incarnate <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    What doth his love, his dying, yet never-dying love demand at our hands? Answer that question who can. It will nonplus men and angels. Blessed be his free grace, we find here that his name is <i>Wonderful</i>. Our new tabernacle is compleated, and the workmen all paid. What is best of all, the Redeemer manifests his glory in it. Every day, souls come crying, “What shall we do to be saved?” This I believe you will look upon to be the best news. But I can now no more.

    Yet a little while, and he that cometh, will come, and will not tarry. I wish you much prosperity under the cross.—You must return the favour; I stand in need of much prayer. Perhaps ere long I may be called to occupy my business in the great waters. If not, <span

    I do not wonder to hear of your being under trials; you are to be made perfect by them. Right-hand and right-eye corruptions are not so easily cut off, or plucked out; but this must be done. Not one <i>Agag</i>, however beautiful, and importunate for life, must be spared: the sword of the spirit must be lifted up, and as an enemy to the <span

    will give you wings and feet, and after all reward you, as though you fled in a strength of your own. O often, often contemplate, and dwell upon his dying for you. This will sweetly constrain you to be willing even to die for him, and powerfully constrain you to be ready to every good word and work. O that I may take this advice myself!

I hope your Ladyship is enabled to bear with fortitude the scratches you must necessarily meet with in this wide howling wilderness. You have a Beloved to lean upon, who is mighty and willing to save. Blessed be his name, for giving you a heart to retire from the pomps and vanities of a dreaming and delusive world.

    he is altogether lovely.—And if persons were more taken up in contemplation of his loveliness, and their own deformities, they would not have so much time to talk of others, nor take so much pains to gain proselytes to any particular party under heaven. Such a practice is beneath the dignity of a free-born child of <span

That <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whom I believe you love, is able, dear Madam, to fill you with this wisdom. He hath promised, “if we ask, it shall be given.” Nay, he hath said, “that he giveth liberally and upbraideth not.” May you be enabled to lay hold on him in the omnipotence of prayer, and find grace to help in every time of need! Have you not found him faithful, in your intended visit to your friend? May you be made wise as an angel of <span

    He delights to disappoint our fears, and even exceeds our hopes. On the seventh instant we left <i>Gravesend</i>; on the eighth we passed through the downs, and yesterday we anchored in this port. Through the channel we met not with the least obstruction, neither had we the least contrary wind all the way. <i>Cape Finisterre</i>, the <i>Burlings</i>, and the rock of <i>Lisbon</i>, (high-lands we desired to make) we came directly upon, and though the wind was very high, yet being for us, it was not so troublesome, but (like sanctified afflictions to the christian) drove us nearer to our desired haven. We are now lying before a large place, where we see hundreds going to worship in their way. We have just been at ours, and I trust I have felt something of that rest, which remains, even on this side eternity, for the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    You and yours are not forgotten by me at his throne. No, I remember you night and day, and am longing for that happy time, when we shall part no more. Though sent without a friend to return with me, yet I am not left alone. I thank the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords, for honouring me so far as to employ me on such expeditions as these. O my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    what am I, that I should be called to leave my native country, and to sacrifice not only my carnal but spiritual affections for thee! Thy presence on earth, thy presence in heaven, will make amends for all. Well! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    this heaven is at hand. Yet a little while, and he that cometh, will come, and will not tarry. O that he may find us busy for him! I am persuaded this will be your case. Add, my dear Sir, to my manifold obligations, by praying that it may be mine also.—Fain would I be kept from flagging in the latter stages of my road; fain would I return to my native country (if I am to return) grown in grace, and in the knowledge
    <a id="p066"></a>of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Indeed he is a good master. He hath given me the affections of all on board, and as kind a Captain as we could desire. What I meet with when on shore, you may know hereafter. I grudge your paying postage for my poor scribble, and yet I know not well how to prevent it. Be pleased to put it down to the amount of our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and if you have any leisure from working for the poor, and trading for him, let me have a line. I recommend you and them to the Redeemer’s never-failing mercy, and am, I trust with some degree of gratitude, very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">H</span>OW soon does the scene shift? At what a distance, in a few days, may we be removed from each other! On the sixteenth instant, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    whom I desire to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, brought me and my orphan charge to this harbour. As yet I have not been on shore, but expect to go to-morrow. At this distance, I see enough to bless the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords for calling me out of darkness into his marvelous light, and for redeeming me from this present evil world. O my dear friend, to an eye fixed on the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    how little, unspeakably little do all sublunary things appear. I hope this will find my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i> crying out from the bottom of his heart, “indeed they are not worth a thought.” Well said, my dear Sir; let us then be laudably ambitious, and get as rich as we can towards <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    such are durable riches. The bank of heaven is a sure bank. I have drawn thousands of bills upon it, and never had one sent back protested. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    helping me, I purpose lodging my little earthly all there. I hope my present poor but valuable cargo, will make some additions to my heavenly inheritance. O free grace! That ever such an ill and hell-deserving wretch as I am, should ever be called out to leave his carnal and spiritual
    <a id="p067"></a>friends, for that friend of sinners the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    These partings are indeed trying to nature; but heaven, my dear Sir, will make amends for all. There I hope to meet you and yours, whom I love in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    there you shall be amply rewarded for all acts of kindness conferred either on me or mine. Increase my obligations, by continuing to pray for us, and accept this as a small tribute of thanks, and a testimony of love unfeigned, from, my dear friend,</p>

    we have been at this place near a fortnight. Our voyage was but about nine days long, and the same <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    who took care of us on the great deep, hath also provided for me on shore. A merchant of great credit hath received me into his house, and every day I have seen or heard something, that hath had a native tendency to make me thankful for the glorious reformation. O that our people were equally reformed in their lives, as they are in their doctrines and manner of worship! But alas! alas!—O for another <i>Luther</i>, O for that wished-for season, when every thing that is antichristian shall be totally destroyed by the breath of the Redeemer’s mouth, and brightness of his appearing! Then should I, even ill and hell-deserving I, be entirely conformed to the copy of my great Exemplar, and nor be such a dwarf as I am in the divine life. As my present situation leads me to be all eye and ear, I endeavour to look more into my heart. But the more I see it, the more I admire the freeness and richness of that grace, that hath called me out of darkness into <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    marvelous light, and made me a minister of the everlasting gospel.
    <a id="p071"></a>May this voyage be over-ruled for my improvement in that delightful employ! Hitherto, I think it hath done me good. The country agrees with my bodily health; and, through grace, I trust what I have seen and heard hath benefited my soul. My fatherless charge are all well, and I hope in a few days we shall set sail for <i>Georgia</i>. From thence, <span

  <p class="align_date">
    <i>Lisbon, April 1, 1754.</i></p>
  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>Y this time, I suppose, you have heard of my arrival at <i>Lisbon</i>, and are wondering what led me thither, especially since my last informed you of my intention to go to <i>Georgia</i> by
    <a id="p073"></a>way of <i>New-York</i>. This was really my design at the time of my writing; but being afterward called by Providence to take with me several orphan children, I thought it most adviseable to go and settle them, and my other domestic affairs, at the Orphan-house first, that I might visit the northern parts of <i>America</i> with more ease and freedom in my own mind.—It happened that the <i>Success</i>, Captain <i>Thomson</i>, bound for <i>Port-Royal, South-Carolina</i>, (which is not very far from <i>Georgia</i>) was then almost ready to sail.—I sent for the Owner, and finding that the ship was to touch at <i>Lisbon</i> to unload some wheat, it occasioned a little demur; but, upon second thoughts, believing it might be serviceable to me, as a preacher and protestant, to see something of the superstitions of the church of <i>Rome</i>, I took my passage, and embarked in the <i>Success</i> the <abbr
      title="seventh">7th</abbr> of <i>March</i>. On the <abbr
      title="fourteenth">14th</abbr>
    we reached <i>Cape Finister</i>. On the <abbr
      title="fifteenth">15th</abbr>
    came in sight of the <i>Burlings</i>; and on the <abbr
      title="sixteenth">16th</abbr>
    anchored safe before <i>Bellem</i>, about four miles distance from <i>Lisbon</i>, the metropolis of <i>Portugal</i>. As I knew nobody there, and had formed but an indifferent idea of the inhabitants, from the account that had been given me of them, I had purposed within myself to keep on board, and go ashore only now and then in the day-time. But Providence so ordered it, that a gentleman of the factory, who had heard me himself, and whose brother had been awakened under my ministry several years ago, immediately, on hearing of my arrival, sent me an offer of his house during my stay. I thankfully accepted it; and special leave being procured for my going ashore, I was carried in a chaise and pair from <i>Bellem</i> to <i>Lisbon</i>. A new scene, both in respect to the situation of the place, the fashion of the buildings, and the dress of the inhabitants, presented itself all the way. But what engaged my attention most, was the number of crucifixes, and little images of the <i>Virgin Mary</i>, and of other real or reputed saints, which were placed almost in every street, or fixed against the walls of the houses almost at every turning, with lamps hanging before them. To these, I observed the people bow as they passed along; and near some of them stood several little companies, singing with great earnestness.――This seemed to me very odd, and gave me an idea of what further ecclesiastical curiosities would probably fall in my way, if I should be detained here any time. These
    <a id="p074"></a>expectations were quickly raised; for, not long after my arrival at my new lodgings, (where I was received and entertained with great gentility, hospitality and friendliness) upon looking out of the window, I saw a company of priests and friars bearing lighted wax tapers, and attended by various sorts of people, some of which had bags and baskets of victuals in their hands, and others carried provisions upon their shoulders on sticks between two. After these, followed a mixed multitude, singing with a very audible voice, and addressing the <i>Virgin Mary</i> in their usual strain, “<i
      lang="la">Ora pro nobis.</i>”
    In this manner they proceeded to the prison, where all was deposited for the use of the poor persons confined therein. But a far more pompous procession of the like nature (as a stander-by informed me) passed by a few days before. In this there were near three hundred <i>Franciscan</i> friars, many of which (besides porters hired for the purpose) were loaded with a variety of food; and those who bore no burden, carried either ladles or spoons in their hands. Sights of this nature being quite a novelty to me, I was fond of attending as many of them as I could. Two things concurred to make them more frequent at this juncture,—the season of <i>Lent</i>,—and an excessive drought, which threatened the total destruction of the fruits of the earth. For the averting so great a judgment, and for the imploring the much longed-for blessing of rain, daily processions had been made from one convent or another, for a considerable time.—One of these I saw: it was looked upon as a pretty grand one, being made up of the <i>Carmelite</i> friars, the parish priests, and a great number of what they call the brothers of the order, who walked two by two in
    divers habits, holding a long and very large lighted wax-taper in their right hands. Amidst these was carried, upon eight or ten mens shoulders, a tall image of the <i>Virgin Mary</i>, in a kind of man’s attire; for I think she had a very fine white wig on her head, (a dress she often appears in) and was much adorned with jewels and glittering stones. At some distance from the Lady, under a large canopy of state, and supported likewise by six or eight persons, came a priest, holding in his hand some noted relic. After him, followed several thousands of people, joining with the friars in singing, “<i
      lang="la">Eandem cantilenam, Ora pro nobis</i>,”
    all the way. Still rain was denied, and still processions were
    <a id="p075"></a>continued. At length the clouds began to gather, and the mercury in the barometer fell very much. Then was brought out a wooden image, which they say never failed. It was the figure of our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    cloathed with purple robes, and crowned with thorns. I think they call him the <span
      class="smcap">Lord of the Passion</span>.
    Upon his shoulders he bore a large cross, under the weight of which he was represented as stooping, till his body bent almost double. He was brought from the <i>Le Grass</i> convent in very great pomp, and placed in a large cathedral church.――Being on board at that time, I lost this sight; but the subsequent evening I beheld the <span
      class="smcap">Seigneur</span>
    fixed on an eminence in a large cathedral church, near the altar, surrounded with wax tapers of a prodigious size.—He was attended by many noblemen, and thousands of spectators of all ranks and stations, who crouded from every quarter, and in their turns, were admitted by the guards to come within the rails, and perform their devotions. This they expressed by kneeling, and kissing the <span
      class="smcap">Seigneur</span>’s
    heel, by putting their left and right eye to it, and then touching it with their beads, which a gentleman in waiting received from them, and then returned again. This scene was repeated for three days successively; and during all this time, the church and space before it was so thronged with carriages and people, that there was scarce any passing. The music on this occasion was extremely soft, and the church was illuminated in a very striking manner. The third day in the forenoon it rained, and soon after the <span
      class="smcap">Seigneur</span>
    was conducted home in as great splendour, and with much greater rejoicing, than when he was brought forth. As my situation was very commodious, I saw the whole; and afterwards went and heard part of the sermon, which was delivered before him, in the church to which the <span

    belonged. The preacher was full of action; and in some part of his discourse, (as one who understood <i>Portuguese</i> informed me) pointing to the image, he said, “Now he is at rest.—He went out in justice, but is returned in mercy.” And towards the conclusion, he called upon the people to join with him in an extempore prayer. This they did with great fervency, which was expressed not only by repeating it aloud, but by beating their breasts, and clapping their cheeks, and weeping heartily.――To compleat the solemnity, immediately
    <a id="p076"></a>after the delivery of the blessing, all on a sudden, from the place near which the image stood, there was heard a most soft and soothing symphony of music, which being ended, the assembly broke up, and I returned to my lodgings; not a little affected, to see so many thousands led away from the simplicity of the gospel, by such a mixture of human artifice and blind superstition, of which indeed I could have formed no idea, had I not been an eye witness. This concern was still increased, by what I heard from some of my fellow passengers, who informed me, that about eleven one night, after I came aboard, they not only heard a friar preaching most fervently before the <span
      class="smcap">Seigneur</span>,
    but also saw several companies of penitents brought in, lashing and whipping themselves severely. How little unlike this, to those who cut themselves with knives and lancets, and cried out from morning till night, “O Baal, hear us.”――Methinks I hear you say, “And had I been present, I should have wished for the spirit of an <i>Elijah</i> to—” Hush, my friend,—I am content to guess at the rest till we meet. In the mean while, let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that there is a season approaching, when the <span
      class="smcap">Lord God</span>
    of <i>Elijah</i> will himself come, and destroy this and every other species of antichrist, by the breath of his mouth, and the brightness of his appearing, even by the all-conquering manifestations of his eternal Spirit. Whether as men, christians, and protestants, we have not more and more reason to pray night and day, for the hastening on of that glorious and long wished-for period, you will be better able to judge, when I send you (as I purpose to do, if I have time) a further account of a <i>Lent</i> procession or two, of which I was also a spectator.――At present I can only beg a continual remembrance at a throne of grace, as being, my dear friend,</p>

  <p class="align_date">
    <i>Lisbon, April 3, 1754.</i></p>
  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH some other business demands my attentions yet I must not forget the promise made you of a further account of the processions I saw at <i>Lisbon</i>.――Some of those
    <a id="p077"></a>already mentioned, were extraordinary, by reason of their great drought; but that which is to be the subject of my present letter, was an annual one: it being customary at <i>Lisbon</i> to exhibit some procession or another every <i>Friday</i> in <i>Lent</i>. An intelligent Protestant, who stood near me, was so good as to be my interpreter of the dumb shew as it passed along.—I say <i>dumb shew</i>: for you must know it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden images, carried on mens shoulders through the streets, intending to represent the life and death of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i>, the founder of one of their religious orders. They were brought out from the <i>Franciscan</i> convent, and were preceded by three persons in scarlet habits, with baskets in their hands, in which they received the alms of the spectators, for the benefit of the poor prisoners. After these, came two little boys in party-coloured cloaths, with wings fixed on their shoulders, in imitation of little angels.—Then appeared the figure of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i>, very gay and beau-like, as he used to be before his conversion. In the next, he was introduced under conviction, and consequently stript of his finery. Soon after this, was exhibited an image of our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    himself, in a purple gown, with long black hair, with <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i> lying before him, to receive his immediate orders. Then came the Virgin Mother, (<i
      lang="la">horresco referens</i>) with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    her son at her left hand, and <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i> making his obeisance to both.――Here, if I remember aright, he made his first appearance in his friar’s habit, with his hair cut short, but not as yet shaved in the crown of his head. After a little space, followed a mitred Cardinal gaudily attired, and before him lay <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i> almost prostrate, in order to be confirmed in his office. Soon after this, he appears quite metamorphosed into a monk, his crown shorn, his habit black, and his loins girt with a knotted cord.—Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a cross, that the marks of the wounds in his hands, feet, and side, might be impressed on the same parts of his body. The prayer is granted; blood comes from the hands, feet, and side; and the saint, with great devotion, receives the impressions. This was represented by red waxen strings, reaching from those parts of the image to the corresponding parts of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i>’s body. Upon this he begins to do wonders; and therefore, in a little while, he is carried along, as holding up a house which was
    <a id="p078"></a>just falling. This miracle, they say, was performed (if my information be true) at <i>Madrid</i>, but the particulars of its history I have forgotten. At length the father dies, and is brought forth lying in his grave. But lo! the briars and nettles under which he lay, are turned into fine and fragrant flowers. After this he is borne along upon a bier covered with a silver pall, and four friars lamenting over him.――He then appears for the last time, but with an increase of power; for he was represented as drawing tormented people out of purgatory with his knotted cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor souls catched at, and took hold of very eagerly. At length came a gorgeous friar under a splendid canopy, bearing in his hand a piece of the holy cross. After him followed two more little winged boys, and then a long train of fat and well-flavoured <i>Franciscans</i>, with their <i
      lang="la">Calceis Fenestratis</i>,
    as <i>Erasmus</i> calls them; and so the procession ended. Methinks I hear you say, “It is full time;”—and so say I: for as the sight itself disgusted me, so I am persuaded the bare narration of it, though ever so short, cannot be very pleasant to one who I know abhors every thing that savours of superstition and idolatry. We will therefore take our leave of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Francis</i>, whose procession was in the day time: but I must tell you it is only to inform you of another of a much more awful and shocking nature, which I saw afterwards at night. About ten o’clock, being deeply engaged in conversation with my kind host, in came an <i>Englishman</i>, and told me in all haste, that he had seen a train of near two hundred penitents passing along, and that in all probability I might be gratified with the same sight, if I hastened to a place whither he would conduct me. I very readily obeyed the summons, and, as curiosity quickened my pace, we soon came up with some of those poor creatures, who were then making a halt, and kneeling in the street, whilst a friar from a high cross, with an image of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    crucified in his hand, was preaching to them and the populace with great vehemence. Sermon being ended, the penitents went forwards, and several companies followed after with their respective preaching friars at their head, bearing crucifixes. These they pointed to and brandished frequently, and the hearers as frequently beat their breasts, and clapped their cheeks. At proper pauses they stopped and prayed, and
    <a id="p079"></a>one of them, more zealous than the rest, before the King’s palace, sounded the word <i
      lang="la">penitentia</i>
    through a speaking trumpet. The penitents themselves were clothed and covered all over with white linen vestments, only holes were made for their eyes to peep out at. All were bare-footed, and all had long heavy chains fastened to their ancles, which, when dragged along the street, made a dismal rattling: but though alike in dress, yet in other respects there was great variety amongst them. For some carried great stones on their backs, and others dead mens bones and skulls in their hands. Some bore large and seemingly very heavy crosses upon their shoulders, whilst others had their arms extended quite wide, or carried a bow full of swords with the points downwards. Most of them whipped and lashed themselves, some with cords, and others with flat bits of iron. It being a moonshine night, I could see them quite well; and indeed some of them struck so hard, that I perceived their backs (left bare on purpose to be slashed) were quite red, and swoln very much by the violence and repetition of the blows. Had my dear friend been there, he would have joined with me in saying, that the whole scene was horrible;—so horrible, that, being informed it was to be continued till morning, I was glad to return from whence I came about midnight.――Had you been with me, I know you would have joined with me in praising and gratefully adoring the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords, for the great wonder of the reformation, and also for that glorious deliverance wrought out for us a few years past, in defeating the unnatural rebellion. O what a mighty spirit and power from on high must <i>Luther</i>, <i>Calvin</i>, <i>Melancthon</i>, <i>Zuinglius</i>, and those glorious reformers, be necessarily endued with, who dared first openly to oppose and stem such a torrent of superstition and spiritual tyranny! and what gratitude owe we to those, who, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    were instrumental in saving us from the return of such spiritual slavery, and such blind obedience to a papal power! To have had a papist for our king;—a papist, if not born, yet from his infancy nursed up at <i>Rome</i>;—a papist, one of whose sons is advanced to the ecclesiastical dignity of a Cardinal, and both under the strongest obligations to support the interest of that church, whose superstitions, as well as political state principles, they have sucked in, and imbibed even from their infancy.
    <a id="p080"></a>But, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the snare is broken, and we are delivered. O for protestant practices to be added to protestant principles! O for an obediential acknowledgment to the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for our repeated deliverances! But alas!――Pardon me, my dear friend, I stop to weep. Adieu. I cannot enlarge, but leaving you to guess from what source my tears flow, I must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE time of our departure hence is just at hand. I cannot move without sending you a few lines; I remember your unmerited love, I remember our affectionate parting, and I trust feel the benefit of your distant prayers. Though called to part with what is dearer to me than life, yet my heavenly Father hath not left me comfortless. True, it is a silent, but I hope an instructive period of life. One must be all eye and ear at <i>Lisbon</i>:—and indeed, I would not but have seen and heard what hath passed here, since our arrival, upon any account. It surpasseth all description. Surely <i>England</i>, and <i>English</i> privileges civil and religious, will be dearer to me than ever. The preachers here have also taught me something; their action is graceful. <i
      lang="la">Vividi oculi,—vividæ manus,—omnia vivida.</i>
    Surely our <i>English</i> preachers would do well, to be a little more fervent in their address. They have truth on their side, why should superstition and falshood run away with all that is pathetic and affecting? But my dear friend needs not this note. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for making you fervent in spirit. Go on, my dear Sir, in the name and strength of <span

      lang="la">Sequar, etsi non passibus æquis.—Nil desperandum Christo duce.</i>
    Pray remember me to all that love him, and are so kind as to enquire after a worthless worm for his great name’s sake. It will be an act of the greatest charity to intercede in my behalf. Alas! alas! I am a dwarf indeed. My dear Sir, pray that I may grow, I cannot bear to live at this dying rate. I want

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> HOPE this will find you more than happy, in the enjoyment of Him, whose death and passion many at this season are peculiarly called upon to remember, and be thankful for. Vast are the outward preparations made here. Altars upon altars are erecting. Penitents upon penitents are walking and lashing themselves: but what I want to have erected and adorned, is an altar in my heart, and the blows and lashes I desire to feel, are the crucifixion and mortification of the old man and its deeds. Without this, all is mere parade. <span

    be praised for opening your eyes, and teaching you the holy art of worshipping him in spirit and in truth. Is it not a glorious privilege? Would you lose it for ten thousand worlds? Blessed be <span

Though we have been detained longer than expectation, yet I trust what I have seen and heard, will do me service in the future part of my life.

It is all in imitation of what is daily practised abroad. May the <span

    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">P</span>ROVIDENCE still detains us at <i>Lisbon</i>, and therefore I know you will be enquiring what more news from thence?—Truly, as extraordinary as ever—for I have now seen the solemnities of an <i>Holy-Thursday</i>, which is a very high day in this metropolis, and particularly remarkable for the grand illuminations of the churches, and the king’s washing twelve poor men’s feet.—Through the interest of a friend, I got admittance into the gallery where the ceremony was performed. It was large, and hung with tapestry; one piece of which represented the humble <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    washing the feet of his disciples.—Before this, upon a small eminence, sat twelve
    <a id="p083"></a>men in black. At the upper end, and in several other parts of the gallery, were side-boards of large gold and silver basons and ewers most curiously wrought; and near these a large table covered with a variety of dishes, all cold, set off and garnished after the <i>Portuguese</i> fashion. Public high mass being over, his majesty came in attended with his nobles, who seemed to me to look like so many <i>Roman</i> senators. The act of washing the feet, I did not get in time enough to see; but that being ended, several of the young noblemen served up the dishes to the king’s brother and uncles; these again handed them to his majesty, who gave (I think) twelve of them in all to each poor man. Every thing was carried on with a great deal of decency and good humour. The young noblemen served very chearfully, their seniors looked quite pleased, and the king and his royal relations behaved in a very polite, easy manner,—upon the whole, though as you may easily guess it was not an exact copy of the tapestry, yet, as the poor mens cloaths and food, when sold, came to about ten moidores; and as there was little mixture of superstition in it, I cannot say
    but I was as well pleased with my morning’s entertainment as with any thing I had seen since my arrival.—I believe the whole took up near two hours. After dinner we went to see the churches; but the <a
      id="p083a" href="#n_12">♦</a>magnificence
    and sumptuousness of the furniture, cannot well be expressed.—Many of them were hung on the occasion with purple damask trimmed with gold.—In one of them there was a solid silver altar of several yards circumference, and near twelve steps high: and in another a gold one, still more magnificent, of about the same dimensions.—Its basis was studded with many precious stones, and near the top were placed silver images, in representation of angels. Each step was filled with large silver candlesticks, with wax-tapers in them, which going up by a regular ascent, ’till they formed themselves into a pyramid, made a most glittering and splendid blaze.—The great altars also of the other churches were illuminated most profusely, and silver pots of artificial flowers, with a large wax-taper between each, were fixed all round several of them.—Between these, were large paintings in black and white, representing the different parts of our Saviour’s passion. And, in short, all was so magnificently, so superstitiously grand, that I am persuaded several thousands of
    <a id="p084"></a>pounds would not defray the expences of this one day. Go which way you would, nothing was to be seen but illuminations within, and hurry without.—For all persons, princes and crowned heads themselves not excepted, are obliged on this day to visit seven churches or altars, in imitation, as is supposed, of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    being hurried from one tribunal to another, before he was condemned to be hung upon the cross.—I saw the queen pass by in great state to visit three of them. Velvet cushions were carried before her Majesty, and boards laid along the streets for herself and retinue to walk upon. Guards attended before and behind, and thousands of spectators stood on each side to gaze at them as they passed along. Being desirous of seeing the manner of their entrance, we got into the last church before they came. It was that of <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Domingo</i>, where was the gold altar before mentioned, and at which her Majesty and train knelt about a quarter of an hour.—All the while, the <i>Dominican</i> friars sung most surprisingly sweet. But as I stood near the altar, over against the great door, I must confess my very inmost soul was struck with a secret horror, when, upon looking up, I saw over the front of the great window of the church, the heads of many hundred <i>Jews</i>, painted on canvas, who had been condemned by what they call the <i>Holy Inquisition</i>, and carried out from that church to be burnt.—Strange way this, of compelling people to come in! Such was not thy method, O meek and compassionate Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Thou camest not to destroy mens lives, but to save them.—But bigotry is as cruel as the grave.—It knows no remorse.—From all its bitter and dire effects, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    deliver us!—But to return to the Queen. Having performed her devotions, she departed and went in a coach of state, I believe, directly from the church to her palace, and without doubt sufficiently fatigued: for, besides walking through the streets to the several churches, her Majesty also, and the princesses, had been engaged in waiting upon, and washing the feet of twelve poor women, in as public a manner as the king. In our walk home, we met his Majesty with his brother and two uncles, attended only with a few noblemen in black velvet, and a few guards without halberts. I suppose he was returning from his last church, and, as one may well imagine, equally fatigued with
    <a id="p085"></a>his royal consort and daughters.—When church and state thus combine to be nursing fathers and nursing mothers to superstition, is it any wonder that its credit and influence is so diffusive among the populace?—O <i>Britain! Britain!</i> hast thou but zeal proportionable to thy knowledge, and inward purity adequate to the simplicity of thy external worship, in what a happy and god-like situation wouldst thou be! Here I could weep again.—Again I leave you to guess the cause; and if I can send you one more letter of a like nature, before we leave this place, it is all you must expect from, my dear friend,</p>

  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER the news already sent you, I thought our <i>Lisbon</i> correspondence would entirely have been put a stop to; for upon returning to my lodgings, (as weary I believe as others that had been running from church to church all day) word was sent me, that our ship would certainly sail the next morning. This news, I own, was not altogether agreeable to me, because I wanted to see the conclusion of the <i>Lent</i> solemnities. However, I made ready; and having dispatched my private affairs the over-night, was conducted very early in the morning, by my kind host, down to <i>Bellem</i>, where the ship lay. We parted. The wind promised to be fair; but dying away, I very eagerly went ashore once more. But how was the scene changed! Before, all used to be noise and hurry;—now, all was hushed and shut up in the most awful and profound silence. No clock or bell had been heard since yesterday noon, and scarce a person was to be seen in the street all the way to <i>Lisbon</i>. About two in the afternoon we got to the place, where (I had heard some days ago) an extraordinary scene was to be exhibited. Can you guess what it was?—Perhaps not. Why then I will tell you. “It was the crucifixion of the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    represented partly by dumb images, and partly by living persons, in a large church belonging to the convent of <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    De Beato</i>.” Several thousands crouded
    <a id="p086"></a>into it; some of whom, as I was told, had been waiting there from even six in the morning.—Through the kind interposition and assistance of a protestant or two, I was not only admitted into the church, but was very commodiously situated to view the whole performance. We had not waited long before the curtain was drawn up. Immediately, upon a high scaffold hung in the front with black bays, and behind with silk purple damask laced with gold, was exhibited to our view an image of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    at full length, crowned with thorns, and nailed on a cross between two figures of like dimensions, representing the two thieves. At a little distance on the right hand, was placed an image of the virgin <i>Mary</i>, in plain long ruffles, and a kind of widow-weeds. Her veil was purple silk, and she had a wire glory round her head.—At the foot of the cross lay, in a mournful pensive posture, a living man, dressed in woman’s cloaths, who personated <i>Mary Magdalen</i>; and not far off stood a young man, in imitation of the beloved disciple.—He was dressed in a loose green silk vesture, and bob-wig.—His eyes were fixed on the cross, and his two hands a little extended. On each side, near the front of the stage, stood two centinels in buff, with formidable caps and long beards; and directly in the front stood another yet more formidable, with a large target in his hand. We may suppose him to be the <i>Roman</i> centurion. To compleat the scene, from behind the purple hangings came out about twenty little purple-vested winged boys, two by two, each bearing a lighted wax-taper in his hand, and a crimson and gold cap on his head.—At their entrance
    upon the stage, they gently bowed their heads to the spectators, then kneeled and made obeisance, first to the image on the cross, and then to that of the virgin <i>Mary</i>.—When risen, they bowed to each other, and then took their respective places over-against one another, on steps assigned for them at the front of the stage. Opposite to this, at a few yards distance, stood a black friar in a pulpit hung in mourning. For a while he paused, and then, breaking silence, gradually lifted up his voice ’till it was extended to a pretty high pitch, though I think scarce high enough for so large an auditory. After he had proceeded in his discourse about a quarter of an hour, a confused noise was heard near the front great door; upon
    <a id="p087"></a>turning my head, I saw four long-bearded men, two of which carried a ladder on their shoulders, and after them followed two more with large gilt dishes in their hands, full of linen, spices, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    These (as I imagined) were the representatives of <i>Nicodemus</i> and <i>Joseph</i> of <i>Arimathea</i>. On a signal given from the pulpit, they advanced towards the steps of the scaffold. But upon their very first attempting to mount it, at the watchful centurion’s nod, the observant soldiers made a pass at them, and presented the points of their javelins directly to their breasts. They are repulsed. Upon this a letter from <i>Pilate</i> is produced. The centurion reads it, shakes his head, and with looks that bespoke a forced compliance, beckons to the centinels to withdraw their arms. Leave being thus obtained, they ascend; and having paid their homage, by kneeling first to the image on the cross, and then to the virgin <i>Mary</i>, they retired to the back of the stage. Still the preacher continued declaiming, or rather (as was said) explaining the mournful scene. <i>Magdalen</i> persists in wringing her hands, and variously expressing her personated sorrow; whilst <i>John</i> (seemingly regardless of all besides) stood gazing on the crucified figure. By this time it was near three o’clock, and therefore proper for the scene to begin to close. The ladders are ascended, the superscription and crown of
    thorns taken off, long white rollers put round the arms of the image, and then the nails knocked out which fastened the hands and feet. Here <i>Mary Magdalen</i> looks most languishing, and <i>John</i>, if possible, stands more thunder-struck than before.—The orator lifts up his voice, and almost all the hearers expressed concern by weeping, beating their breasts, and smiting their cheeks.—At length the body is gently let down. <i>Magdalen</i> eyes it, and, gradually rising, receives the feet into her wide-spread handkerchief; whilst <i>John</i> (who hitherto stood motionless like a statue) as the body came nearer the ground, with an eagerness that bespoke the intense affection of a sympathizing friend, runs towards the cross, seizes the upper part of it into his clasping arms, and, with his disguised fellow-mourner, helps to bear it away. And here the play should end, was I not afraid you would be angry with me, if I did not give you an account of the last act, by telling you what became of the corpse after it was taken down. Great preparations
    <a id="p088"></a>were made for its interment. It was wrapped in linen and spices, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and being laid upon a bier richly hung, was afterwards carried round the church-yard in grand procession. The image of the virgin <i>Mary</i> was chief mourner, and <i>John</i> and <i>Magdalen</i>, with a whole troop of friars with wax-tapers in their hands, followed after. Determined to see the whole, I waited its return, and in about a quarter of an hour the corps was brought in, and deposited in an open sepulchre prepared for the purpose; but not before a priest, accompanied by several of the same order in splendid vestments, had perfumed it with incense, sung to and kneeled before it. <i>John</i> and <i>Magdalen</i> attended the obsequies; but the image of the virgin <i>Mary</i> was carried away and placed upon the front of the stage, in order to be kissed, adored, and worshipped by the people.—This I saw them do with the utmost eagerness and reverence. And thus ended this <i>Good Friday</i>’s tragi-comical, superstitious, idolatrous farce. A farce, which whilst I saw, as well as now whilst I am describing it, excited in me an high indignation.—Surely, thought I, whilst attending on such a scene of mock devotion, if ever, now is the dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    crucified afresh; and I could then, and even now, think of no other plea for the poor beguiled devotees, than that which suffering innocence put up himself for his enemies, when actually hanging upon the cross, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” There was but one thing wanting to raise one’s resentment to the highest pitch, and that was, for one of the soldiers to have pierced the side of the image upon the cross. This in all probability you have heard hath actually been done in other places, and with a little more art, might, I think, have been performed here. Doubtless it would have afforded the preacher as good, if not a better opportunity of working upon the passions of his auditory, than the taking down the superscription and crown of thorns, and wiping the head with a blooded cloth, and afterwards exposing it to the view of the people; all which I saw done before the body was let down.—But alas! my dear friend, how mean is that eloquence, and how entirely destitute of the demonstration of the spirit, and of a divine power, must that oratory necessarily be, that stands in need of such a train of superstitious pageantry to render it
    <a id="p089"></a>impressive!—Think you, my dear friend, that the apostle <i>Paul</i> used or needed any such artifices to excite the passions of the people of <i>Galatia</i>, amongst whom, as he himself informs us, “<span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    was crucified, and evidently set forth?”—But thus it is, and thus it will be, when simplicity and spirituality are banished from our religious offices, and artifice and idolatry seated in their room.—I am well aware that the <i>Romanists</i> deny the charge of idolatry; but after having seen what I have seen this day, as well as at sundry other times since my arrival here, I cannot help thinking but a person must be capable of making more than metaphysical distinctions, and deal in very abstract ideas indeed, fairly to evade the charge.—If weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, I am positive the scale must turn on the protestant side.—But such a balance these poor people are not permitted to make use of! Doth not your heart bleed for them? Mine doth I am sure, and I believe would do so more and more, was I to stay longer, and see what they call their <i>Hallelujah</i>, and grand devotions on <i>Easter-day</i>.—But that scene is denied me.—The wind is fair, and I must away.—Follow me with your prayers, and believe me to be, my dear friend,</p>

O that the Redeemer may make it a sweet one! Some time next month, perhaps I may have the pleasure of seeing you and yours, and my other dear <i>Boston</i> friends. As I am entirely unprovided with travelling furniture, I have thoughts of coming as far as <i>Rhode-island</i> by water. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall have timely notice, or it may be, I may come upon you unawares. Strange! that I should be in this dying world till now. What changes have I seen! What changes must I expect to see before my final departure, if the Redeemer is pleased to lengthen out this span of life. Welcome, welcome, my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    whatever cup thou shalt see meet to put into my hands! Only sweeten it with thy love, and then, though bitter in itself, it cannot but be salutary. Alas! how little do we know of ourselves, till we are tried, and how hard doth the old man die! Well! blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, die he shall. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath given him his deadly blow, and at the best he only lives a dying life. Thanks be to <span

    for such a Saviour! O for a thousand tongues to shew forth his praise! <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    cloath me with humility, that I may every day know more and more the honour conferred upon me in being made a poor pilgrim for thee! Keep me travelling, keep me working, or at least beginning to begin to work for thee till I die! But whither am I going? Excuse me, my dear Sir.—I am writing to a beloved <i>Gaius</i>. <span

    hath brought me hither, and last night gave me an opportunity of recommending his dying love. When I ascended the pulpit, and found your place empty, I was somewhat affected; but I have met with so many changes in the church as well as the world, that it is time for me to begin to learn to be surprized at nothing. Some time next month, I hope to come as far as <i>Boston</i>. I know, my dear Sir, that you will pray, it may be in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of <span

    What is to befall me I know not; Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit! Fain would I be as clay in thy hands. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    when shall it once be? But I am a stubborn, ill and hell-deserving creature. Less than the least of all, shall be my motto still. Amazing,—that the Redeemer should suffer such a wretch to speak or travel for him. Surely his name and nature is Love. O that I could but begin to begin to love him! My obligations increase daily. In <i>England</i> the word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    runs and is glorified indeed. <i>Georgia</i> and <i>Bethesda</i> I left in growing circumstances. The orphan-family now consists of one hundred and six, black and white. A young man that hath been a student there, succeeds <abbr

    make their extremity thy opportunity to help and relieve them! But I shall weary you, and detain you too long from more important work. May the great head of divine influence bless you and yours, and all your present flock! Some of them I know. If you should see dear <abbr

Next week I purpose going to <i>Philadelphia</i>, and then shall come back again here in my way to <i>Boston</i>. Whether I shall then return to <i>Bethesda</i>, or embark for <i>England</i>, is uncertain.—I fear matters will not be settled at the orphan-house, unless I go once more; I have put some upon their trial, and shall want to see how they behave. During my passage from <i>Charles-Town</i>, I left a few lines for you; I thought to have written an account of <i>Bethesda</i> for the press, but could by no means get freedom. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    time is the best. I owe for three of the negroes who were lately bought, but hope to be enabled to pay for them at my return from the northward. My <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    can, and will supply all my wants, according to his riches in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Glory be to his great name, he hath now taught me a little to be alone. His presence keeps me company, and I find it sweet to run about for him. I find the door all along the continent is as open as ever, and the way seems clearing up for the neighbouring islands. What a pity is it, that we can only be at one place at once, for the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span

    Many things have concurred, to prove that my coming at this time was of <span

The word hath still free course. The poor despised Methodists are as lively as ever, and in several churches the gospel is now preached with power.

As for myself, I can only say “that less than the least of all,” must be my motto still. I labour but feebly, and yet, O amazing condescension! <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    owns and succeeds such feeble labours. People still continue to flock to the gospel, like doves to the windows. Next week I begin to take my country range. Be so good, my dear Sir, to add to my obligations, by continuing to remember a poor but willing pilgrim, and to salute all my dear friends as they come in your way. I hope, <abbr

    <i>A――</i> (to whom I send cordial respects) goes hand in hand with you, striving together for the faith and the practice of the gospel.—Glorious strife this! I do not forget the books I promised to look out for.—I have spoken to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>H――</i>, but he says they are very difficult to be procured. I would write to the Chief Justice, but suppose he is at the northward. Will you be pleased to accept of my <i>Lisbon</i> letters, to be disposed of as you think proper? My little communion-book is not yet come out. <span
      class="smcap">God</span> be
    <a id="p123"></a>praised, that there is a time coming when we shall need books and ordinances no more, but shall be admitted into an uninterrupted communion and fellowship with the blessed Trinity for evermore. The <span

    I am quite satisfied in your present employ, and doubt not (if you are cloathed with humility, as I trust you will be) but <span

    This be your happy lot! As for your affair with <abbr

    <i>C――</i>, I can only say, you have my leave to act as you think best. —Shew thy will, O <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows, I can little afford it; but I can as yet trust on him, who feedeth the ravens, and hath promised to supply all my wants. O that the <span

    of all Lords may keep you all at <i>Bethesda</i> of one heart and one mind, and give you to send me such news, as may gladden my frequently burdened (though I hope disinterested) mind; and cause me to go on with more chearfulness and joy! Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    my feeble labours on this side the water, are owned and succeeded. People seem to be as lively as ever. I hope the time will come, when <i>Bethesda</i> also

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since I received your last kind letter, I have been so perpetually engaged in preaching, travelling, and a multiplicity of other business, that I have not been able to answer it till now. In <i>London</i> the word runs and is glorified, and every day almost we have heard of fresh ministers of our national church being called out, and spirited up to preach the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    This is my first excursion: I came through <i>Gloucestershire</i>, where the fields were white, ready unto harvest. Thrice last Lord’s-day, many many thousands attended on the word preached, and I believe a divine power accompanied it. That is all in all.—People in this place hear as for eternity. Next week I shall travel further westward; but whether I can see <i>Scotland</i> this summer, the Redeemer only knows. But whether absent or present, you, my dear Sir, and my other <i>Scotch</i> friends, have my poor prayers night and day, that your souls and bodies may prosper and be in health. O that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may hear you for unworthy me! I long, I long to do something for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Glad would I be to serve the church of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    any way. If you remember, I hinted to you something about getting a Doctor’s degree for President <i>Burr</i>; since that I wrote to the Marquis of <i>L――n</i>. His Lordship writes thus: “The university of <i>Edinburgh</i> desire of me to obtain some account of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Aaron Burr</i>’s literature, or performances: this I hope you will do, and a diploma will be immediately transmitted.” By this post, I shall write what I know of the President, but I would have you and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>E――</i> write also, immediately to the Marquis. Surely he is the most worthy, ingenious, diligent, and truly christian President of his age, now in the world. He hath published something lately to animate our people against the common enemy. I have it at <i>London</i>, and hope you have it with you. If so, be pleased to
    <a id="p126"></a>transmit it to the Marquis. I shall mention it, and so do you, to his Lordship. Adieu, my very dear Sir, adieu. I must away. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> bless and prosper you and yours, and all the dear followers of the Lamb! I cannot forget you, and hope never shall, whilst I have strength to subscribe, what indeed I am, my very dear friend,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">H</span>OW shall I express my gratitude to your Lordship, for condescending to answer my poor letter, and so readily concurring with the motion made in it, for a degree being procured for my worthy friend? The great Head of the church will bless and reward your Lordship for it. Never was there a man in the world, that could be more safely recommended as a scholar, and a truly christian minister of the gospel, and a laborious prudent President of a college, than <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Aaron Burr</i>.—He was educated at <i>Yale College</i> in <i>Connecticut, New England</i>; and for his pregnant abilities, and many years well approved piety, was unanimously chosen to succeed the Reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>D――</i> in the care of <i>New-Jersey</i> college. It would have delighted your Lordship, to have seen how gloriously he filled the chair last year, at the <i>New-Jersey</i> commencement. His <i>Latin</i> oration was beautifully elegant, and was delivered with an unaffected, yet striking energy and pathos. As a preacher, disputant, and head of a college, he shines in <i>North America</i>; and the present prosperity of the <i>New Jersey</i> college, is, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    greatly owing to his learning, piety, and conduct. The students revere and love him. Your Lordship might have testimonials enough from good Governor <i>B――r</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Jonathan Edwards</i>, <i
      lang="la">cum multis aliis</i>.
    And I believe, they would all concur in saying, “that of his age (now upwards of forty) there is not a more accomplished deserving President in the world.” As for any thing of his in print, that can be referred to, I cannot say, unless it be a little pamphlet lately published, in which he hath animated the people against the common enemy, and discovered a close attachment to the interest of our
    <a id="p127"></a>rightful sovereign King <i>George</i>. May the King of kings long preserve his important and precious life! This piece of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Burr</i>’s I have at <i>London</i>, and hope it is in <i>Scotland</i>. I just now wrote to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>G――</i> of <i>Glasgow</i>, who, together with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>J―― E――</i>, I suppose will write to your Lordship concerning <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Burr</i>. I wish the diploma may be transmitted against the next commencement. It will endear your Lordship more and more to the good people of <i>America</i>. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords vouchsafe your Lordship a good degree in the kingdom of heaven! O for the lowest place there! It will be abundantly too high for such an unworthy wretch as I am: but his name and nature is Love. He still vouchsafes to employ me, and still continues to countenance my feeble labours. At <i>London</i> we have enjoyed golden seasons, and in the country the fields are white ready unto harvest. O that we may be helped to bear the heat and burden of every day! That your Lordship may live long to do much for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and be at last gathered like a ripe shock of corn into his heavenly garner, is the earnest prayer of, my Lord,</p>

Had I the least leisure or strength, I should have written a letter of condolence to your Ladyship from <i>Bristol</i>. There I heard of the death of good Lady <i>Ann</i>, and was glad to find that Miss <i>W――</i> bore the news of it with so much composure. Alas! how many have your Ladyship lived to see go before you!

I wish your Ladyship’s plan may do; but I fear the parts about your Ladyship are too cold. O how unworthy of such a guest! Well, honoured, ever-honoured Madam, in the <i>New-Jerusalem</i>, your Ladyship will have company enough. There the Redeemer shall hold up before the mighty and the noble, and let them see what almighty, rich, and sovereign grace could do. Be pleased, my good Lady, to excuse the length of this. Gratitude always gives motion to my pen, when writing to your Ladyship. I am ashamed, that I have not so much as a pepper-corn to offer as an humble tribute. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    the ever-loving, the altogether lovely <span

It hath tottered lately more than ever, and yet the Redeemer vouchsafes so to comfort me within, that methinks I am not yet to die, but live and declare the works of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    O that I may begin to begin to do something for my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    I am afraid we are at the eve of a war: but fear not. <i>Bethesda</i> especially, I believe, will be hid under the shadow of the Redeemer’s wings. Whilst I have persons there (as I think is the case now) that act with a single eye, I am persuaded it will be like the <i>burning bush</i>. Pray remember me to all in the kindest manner. I hope to write when the childrens cloaths are ready. We have blessed seasons at Tabernacle. I have met with some outward as well as inward trials; but this is my comfort, “The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    knoweth the way that I take. When I am tried I shall come forth like gold.” O that faith and patience may have their perfect work in this sin-sick soul! Desire dear <i>Nat</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Dix</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    not to be uneasy, because I do not write now; it is impracticable. Night and day you are all upon my heart, and I long to hear how you go on. My blessing attends you all, even you and the children. Surely, was I retired from public work, feeding <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    lambs should be my constant employ. But alas! I must be in the front of the battle. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    magnify thy strength in my weakness, or I shall deny thee and desert my post! Pray hard all of you, I intreat you, for me, and let me know all your wants. I will labour night and day to have them supplied, and will pray the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls to pay you blessed wages. I know you will be content with
    <a id="p132"></a>such a paymaster. I commend you all to his never-failing mercy, as being, dear <abbr

    <i>Elect Lady</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">H</span>OW glad was I some time ago to receive a letter from your Ladyship! How glad am I now to sit down to answer it, and thereby renew a correspondence, which to me was always profitable and delightful! Shall I wish your Ladyship joy? Of what? Not barely of your additional estate and honour, but of your having an opportunity, with your noble Lord, of moving in a superior orb, and letting your light shine more before men. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords only knows, how I love and honour you both; though I have not written, yet I have not ceased praying for you and yours these many years. Your honoured family on both sides, must always be dear to me. What <i>Bethels</i>, what gates of heaven have we been in together, whilst engaged in social prayer, and reading and opening the lively oracles of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Had I wings, gladly would I fly to see your Ladyship’s dear little growing family: but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows, whether I shall be able to reach <i>Scotland</i> this year. I am now at <i>Norwich</i>, where there hath undoubtedly been a glorious work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Twice a day, both gentle and simple flock to hear the word, and I think it comes with power. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what am I? In <i>London</i>, I think, our people are as lively as ever; in <i>Bristol</i> they are the same; and as for <i>America</i>, words cannot express the glorious scenes that opened in various parts, especially at <i>Boston</i> in <i>New-England</i>. The tide ran full as high as ever your Ladyship knew it at <i>Edinburgh</i>, or in any part of <i>Scotland</i>. This I know is the best news I can send to your Ladyship; for what news, comparatively speaking, is worth hearing, except that which concerns the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    What beauties worth admiring, but the beauties of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    What riches worth possessing, but the substantial and durable riches of the divine life? What honour worth acquiring, but that honour which
    <a id="p133"></a>cometh from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    May these be the beauties, these the riches, these the honours of you and your noble Lord! I assure your Ladyship that my heart springs when I think of him, or write his name. I truly loved the father, I as truly and most affectionately respect and love the son. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    almighty bless you both, and give you grace to keep yourselves unspotted from the world! Glad shall I be to see his Lordship in town. In the mean while, I hope his Lordship, and the honourable family where you are, will accept not of bare compliments, but unfeigned and most cordial acknowledgments and respects. May the great physician of souls vouchsafe to give you all thriving souls in healthy bodies! I am glad to hear good Lady <i>D――</i> is well. My obligations to her, and all your honoured family, are very great. Be pleased to accept this poor pepper-corn, which, except my poor prayers, is all the acknowledgment that can be made by, my good Lady,</p>

As I expect to be in town some time next week, I choose to defer writing more till we have a personal interview. My time is too precious to be employed in hearkening to, or vindicating of myself against, the false and invidious insinuations of narrow and low-life informers. Never was I more satisfied of my call to any place, than of my present call to <i>Norwich</i>. The Redeemer knows the way that I take. I came hither purely for his glory, without the least design to make a party for myself, or to please or displease any other party whatsoever. In this
    <a id="p134"></a>way, and in this spirit, through his divine assistance, I hope to go on. Blessed be his name, I trust my feeble labours have not been in vain. Sin, I hope, hath been prevented, errors detected, sinners convicted, saints edified, and my own soul sweetly refreshed. But I must add no more. That <span

    may give us all a right judgment in all things, and keep all parties whatsoever from giving a wrong touch to the ark, is and shall be the constant prayer of, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

He hath once more brought me safe over the mighty waters, and hath vouchsafed to own my poor feeble labours in yonder new world.

If ever the Redeemer, in his good providence, should bring me thither again, I can then converse with <abbr

If I know any thing of myself, I want to supplant none, but to strengthen the hands of all that preach and live <span

    <i>Dear Miss</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW days past, as I was going into the Tabernacle to read letters, yours came to hand; immediately I read it among the rest, and you and my other dear <i>New-England</i> friends had the prayers of thousands. But how did I wish to be transported to <i>America</i>! How did I long to stir up all against the common enemy, and to be made instrumental in doing my dear country some little service! But surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    sent me over at this juncture, and therefore I hope to be resigned. Already, blessed be his name, he hath vouchsafed to own my feeble labours in <i>London</i>, <i>Gloucestershire</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Bath</i>, and <i>Norwich</i>. I have been at the last place very lately, and notwithstanding offences have come, there hath been a glorious work begun, and is now carrying on. The Polite and Great seem to hear with much attention, and I scarce ever preached a week together with greater freedom. Praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O my soul! I am now going my northern circuit, and perhaps may take a trip to <i>Ireland</i>. O what a pity is it, that we have but one body and one soul for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>! I write this from dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>H――</i>’s, who sends kind love to all his dear <i>New-England</i> friends, and earnestly begs the continuance of their prayers. He is now writing another volume upon sanctification: that, you say, dear Miss, is what you want. That is what the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    longs to give. Out of his fulness we are all to receive even grace for grace. But how slow are we to believe! <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I believe, help my unbelief! must be my language still. I thank your honoured father for the kind present of the sermons, charter, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    I see you are resolved to increase my obligations, till they amount to a prodigious sum. My blessed Master must pay you all. O that I may be remembered before him; night and day, in public and in private! Dear <i>New-England</i>, dear <i>Boston</i> lies upon my heart; surely the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will not give it over into the enemies hand. He hath too many praying ministers and praying people there, for such a dreadful catastrophe. Immediately upon hearing of your late
    <a id="p137"></a>defeat, I preached from those words, “When the enemy comes in like a flood, then the spirit of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    lifts up a standard against him.” This we shall find true in a temporal and spiritual sense.</p>

    <i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>CCORDING to my promise, before I embarked for <i>England</i>, I sent you the copy of my oath, from <i>Charles-Town</i>; which, I fear, is not come to hand, because not mentioned in either of your letters, which I had the pleasure of receiving a few days ago. In my way northward, I take the first opportunity of thanking you for both, and at the same time heartily thank the Captain of our salvation, for giving you grace to stand to your colours, and persist in your spiritual warfare. Perhaps, ere this reaches <i>Boston</i>, you may be called out in the service of your country. May your head, and the heads of all engaged, be covered in every day of battle; and may our troops be made in the end more than conquerors through the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    This is what we are assured of in our spiritual combat.—<span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    who is truth itself, hath told us, that nothing shall pluck us out of his almighty hands. Though faint then, let us still pursue. Through the Redeemer strengthening me, I am yet continuing my feeble labours, which, I trust, are not in vain in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Fain would I be with you; but Providence seems to have cast my lot at present here. Well, my dear Sir, there is a place, at which, though absent from, we may be present with each other; I mean the throne of grace. There, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I will often meet you. I know you will accept the challenge, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    <a id="p141"></a>himself will say, <i>Amen</i>. Glad should I be to hear from you frequently. O for good news from dear <i>New-England</i>! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for what you send me concerning <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>P――</i>. May root and branch be spared for the Mediator’s glory! To his tender, never-failing mercy, do I most humbly commend you, and all other enquiring friends, as being, my dear Sir,</p>

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――</i> I find your harp was hanging upon the willows, your chariot wheels taken off, and your poor soul driving heavily. Add to all this,—Satan was besetting you on every side, and so daring as to say, “Where is now thy <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?”—This
    is his common artifice; thus he attacked the great High-priest and blessed apostle of our profession, “If thou be the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>” But if you love not <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whence this pain of absence? Why so often crying out,</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered txt_i">
      <p>For to my soul it’s hell to be</p>
      <p>But for one moment void of thee?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00">
    This is not the language of a hypocrite. No: it is the native, genuine cry of a new and heaven-born soul. Woman, therefore, why weepest thou? Thy <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath drank of this bitter cup before thee.</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered txt_i">
      <p>He knows what this temptation means,</p>
      <p>For he hath felt the same.</p>

  <p class="in_00">
    Look then to Him, dear Madam, who upon the cross cried out in the bitterness of his soul, “My <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    why hast thou forsaken me?” The Redeemer is now only giving you blessings in disguise, and teaching you instructive lessons by the thorns and briars of the wilderness. Now is the time
    <a id="p142"></a>for you to prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    yours, and to learn to live upon a <span

    that changeth not. Be pleased to excuse this freedom. At <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――d</i>’s desire I take it. Your advice to him, amidst all your gloom, bespeaks your concern for the ark of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    I wish he may take it. But I love not to interfere in other people’s plans, any further than I can contribute a mite towards promoting the common salvation. This principle made me incline to see <i>Ireland</i>, but I believe the season is too far gone. The Redeemer’s time is best. O that all may have grace given them to wait his leisure! Then will affairs have a more comfortable aspect, and many wrong touches of the ark be happily prevented. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in many places the word runs and is glorified. O that I could begin to begin to do something for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>! I wish that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>C――</i> may be raised to work for him once more. And yet, methinks it is cruel to wish him to stay longer out of heaven. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give me patience to wait till my wished-for change shall come! My cordial respects await all that love <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> KNOW not how long it is since I left your Ladyship; but this I know, a sense of the satisfaction I felt when at <a
      id="p143a" href="#n_14">♦</a><i>Donnington</i>,
    still lies upon my heart. Surely, was I not called out to public work, waiting upon and administring to your Ladyship in holy offices would be my choice and highest privilege. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    calls, and therefore I travel to do or suffer thy will, O <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    The only new ground that hath been broken up, I think is <i>Liverpool</i>; there the prospect is promising. I preached in a great square on the Lord’s day, and the alarm I hear went through the town. At <i>Bolton</i> the cup of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people ran over; and at <i>Manchester</i> we had large auditories and blessed seasons. At <i>Leeds</i> we felt what is unutterable, and at <i>Bradford</i>, I believe, last <i>Sunday</i> the congregation consisted of at least ten thousand. But O how hath my pleasure been alloyed at <i>Leeds</i>! I rejoiced there with trembling; for unknown to me, they had almost finished a large house in order to form a separate congregation. If this scheme succeeds, an awful separation I fear will take place amongst the
    <a id="p144"></a>societies. I have written to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――</i>, and have done all I could to prevent it. O this self-love, this self-will! It is the devil of devils. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    may thy blessed spirit purge it out of all our hearts! But O how must the divine Paraclete sit as a refiner’s fire upon the heart, in order to bring this about! Few choose such fiery purgations, and therefore so few make the progress that might justly be expected of them in the divine life. Make me, O <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    willing to be made, willing to be, to do, or suffer what thou pleasest, and then――what then?—this foolish fluttering heart will sweetly be moulded into the divine image.—This I write from <i>Newcastle</i>, where the people twice a day hear the gospel gladly. At <i>York</i> I hope a fine gentleman was touched, and several I find were awakened there, and here also, at my last visit. What to do now, I know not. Calls on all sides are very loud, and it is too late to go either to <i>Ireland</i> or <i>Scotland</i>. O my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!—Winter
    is at hand, and in the summer how little hath been done for thee! I cannot bear to live at this poor dying rate. My good and ever-honoured Lady, add; for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake add to my already innumerable obligations, by praying for a poor unfruitful and ungrateful dwarf. I am sick of my vileness, and yet just comes in a letter acquainting me, that my preaching hath been blessed to many this morning. Good <span

    All we can do on this side the water, is to pray. This I trust thousands are doing every day.—I seldom preach, without mentioning dear <i>New England</i>. O for more good news from that part of yonder new world! O that this time of outward danger, may be sanctified to the exciting of greater zeal against our inward spiritual enemies! For after all, the man of sin in our own hearts, is the greatest foe the real christian hath to fear. May <span

    the prospect is promising here! In the north of <i>England</i>, the word runs and is glorified more than ever, and in <i>London</i> people flock like doves to the windows:—and yet I feel a strong attraction for <i>America</i>. Pray be so kind, very dear Sir, to send me some account now and then, how matters stand.—Perhaps it may be of some service. I could enlarge, but must drop a line or two more to some more friends, and therefore can only send my most cordial salutations to yourself, and whole houshold, and begging a continued interest in your prayers, subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and earnestly prayed, in my poor feeble manner, that grace, mercy, and peace might be multiplied upon your Ladyship, and your happy family. The Court, in the best sense of the word, is now removed to <i>Clifton</i>. For there only is the real court kept, where <span

    O for further leadings into the chambers of that selfish, sensual, and devilish imagery, that yet lie latent in my partly renewed heart. This self-love, what a <i>Proteus</i>! This self-will, what an Hydra? This remaining body of sin and death, what an antichrist! what a scarlet whore! what a hell! what a red dragon! what a cursed monster is it! How hard, how slow he dies! O what gratitude do I owe to the bruiser of this serpent’s head! O for a heart gladly to embrace every cross, every trying dispensation, that may have a tendency to poison, or starve, or nip the buddings of the old, and cherish, promote, or cause to bloom and blossom the graces and tempers of the new man in my soul! Ordinances, providences, doctrines, (I am more and more convinced) are of no service to believers, than as they are attended with this mortifying and life-giving power. Happy family, that have this one thing in view! Happy retirement, that is improved to this blessed purpose! Happy, therefore, good Lady <i>H――n</i>, and the other elect Ladies, who are determined thus to go on hand in hand to heaven! All hail, ye new-born, heaven-born souls! ye know, by happy experience, that <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR Ladyship’s kind and condescending letter should not have lain so long by me, had not bodily weakness, and my <i>Christmas</i> labours, prevented my writing. Indeed and indeed my good Lady, it hath been a joyful mournful season to my inward man. For exclusive of a pretty sharp outward trial, <i>Saturday</i> last being my birth-day, my soul was deeply exercised from morning till evening, in thinking how much in one-and-forty years I have sinned against, and how little I have done for an infinitely good and ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This impression yet lies deep upon my heart, and therefore, through divine assistance, I purpose to end the old year in preaching on those words, “I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.” O that all things belonging to the old man, may die in me, and all things belonging to the new man live and grow in me! But alas, this is a work of time. Every day and every hour must we be passing from death to life. Mortification and vivification make up the whole of the divine work in the new-born soul. Come, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    come quickly; have compassion on this barren fig-tree, and if it is to be spared another year, so dig and dung round it, that it may bring forth much fruit unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    But shall I conceal the goodness of my long-suffering Master? No: I dare not;—for in spite of my unworthiness, he still continues to smile upon my poor ministrations, and gives me to see his stately steps in the great congregations. A noble chapel is now opened in <i>Long-acre</i>, where I am to read prayers and preach twice a week. Hundreds went away last night, who could not come in; but those that could, I trust, met with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. <abbr

    (says the Apostle <i>Paul</i>) shall supply all your need according to his riches in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.”
    Away, and endorse it afresh, and send it directly away post on the wings of prayer. Never fear any trial that sends you to your knees; You must then needs go forward whether you know it or not. I would enlarge, but weakness prevents. I have been in the furnace; I hope it is intended to prepare me for fresh success. The awakening at <i>London</i> seems to be quite new. Adieu, adieu.

Ever since I came from the North, it hath pleased a sovereign Lord to visit me with a violent cold and sore throat, which threatened an inflammatory quinsey. Such a thing, I hoped, would have soon carried me, where this cold heart should for ever be inflamed with seraphic love. But alas! I fear this wish’d-for time is not at hand. One physician prescribed a <i>perpetual blister</i>, but I have found <i>perpetual preaching</i> to be a better remedy. When this grand catholicon fails, it is over with me. You will pray, that (if I must put out to sea again) it may be to take some fresh prizes for my <span

    Every day brings us fresh news of newly awakened souls. Both at this and the other end of the town, (where I now preach at a chapel twice a week) there is a glorious stirring amongst the dry bones. My heart is pained for dear <i>America</i>; but I trust the <span

    <span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW weeks ago, several serious persons chosen to be a committee for one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i>, applied to me in the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and a multitude of souls desirous of hearing the gospel, to preach at a place commonly called <i>Long-Acre</i> chapel. At the same time they acquainted me, “That the place was licensed; that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i> either had taken, or was to take it for a certain term of years, and had preached in it for a considerable time, as a protestant Dissenting minister: notwithstanding, (they added) I might use the Liturgy if I thought proper, so that I would but come and preach once or twice a week.” Looking upon this as a providential call, from him, who in the days of his flesh taught all that were willing to hear, <i>on a mount</i>, <i>in a ship</i>, or <i>by the sea-side</i>, and who after his ascension, commanded us by his Apostle, to be “instant in season and out of season,” I readily complied, and humbly hope that my feeble, though I trust sincere labours, have not been altogether in vain in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    This being the case, your Lordship will necessarily suppose, that I was somewhat surprized at the prohibition I received from your Lordship this evening. For I looked upon the place as a particular person’s property, and being, as I was informed, not only unconsecrated, but also licensed according to law, I thought I might innocently preach the love of a crucified Redeemer, and for his great name’s sake, loyalty to the best of princes our dread sovereign King <i>George</i>, without giving any just offence to <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, much less to any bishop or overseer of the church of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    As I have therefore given notice of preaching to-morrow evening, and every <i>Tuesday</i> and <i>Thursday</i> whilst I am in town, I hope your Lordship will not look upon it as <i>contumacy</i>, or done out of contempt, if I persist in prosecuting my
    <a id="p158"></a>design, till I am more particularly apprized wherein I have erred. Controversy, my Lord, is what I abhor, and as raising popular clamours, and ecclesiastical dissentions must be quite unseasonable, especially at this juncture, when <i>France</i> and <i>Rome</i> and hell ought to be the common butt of our resentment, I hope your Lordship will be so good as to inform yourself and me more particularly about this matter; and upon due conviction, as I have no design but to do good to precious souls, I promise to submit. But if your Lordship should judge it best to decline this method, and I should be called to answer for my conduct, either before a spiritual court, or from the press, I trust the irregularity I am charged with, will appear justifiable to every true lover of <i>English</i> liberty, and what is <i>all</i> to me, will be approved of at the awful and impartial tribunal of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, in obedience to whom I beg leave to subscribe myself, my Lord,</p>

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> THIS evening received your Lordship’s kind letter, and though it is late, and nature calls for rest, yet in the fear of him to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid, I desire now to sit down and give your Lordship an explicit answer. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, even that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by whom I am to be judged, can witness, that with a disinterested view to promote his glory, and the welfare of precious and immortal souls, I entered into holy orders, according to the form of ordination of the church of <i>England</i>; and, as thousands can testify, for near these twenty years last past, I have conscientiously defended her homilies and articles, and upon all occasions spoken well of her liturgy. Either of these, together with her discipline, I am so far from renouncing, much less from throwing aside all regard to, that I earnestly pray for the due restoration of the one, and daily lament the wanton departure of too, too many from the other. But, my Lord, what can I do? When I acted in the most regular manner, and when I was bringing multitudes even of Dissenters themselves to croud the churches, without any other reason being given than that too many followed after me, I was denied the use of them. Being thus excluded, and many thousands of ignorant souls, that perhaps would neither go to church nor meeting-houses, being very hungry after the gospel, I thought myself bound in duty to deal out to them the bread of life. Being further ambitious to serve my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    my King, and my country, I sacrificed my affections, and left my native soil, in order to begin and carry on an Orphan-house in the infant colony of <i>Georgia</i>, which, through the divine blessing, is put upon a good foundation. This served as an introduction, though without design, to my visiting the other parts of his Majesty’s dominions in <i>North-America</i>; and I humbly hope, that many made truly serious in that foreign clime, will be my joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    If it was not for this hope, nay, my Lord, if I was not assured, that the blessed Redeemer (O amazing
    <a id="p160"></a>condescension) hath vouchsafed to own me for the real conversion, and turning of many from darkness to light, the weakness of my frequently worn out and decaying body, the innumerable temptations that have beset my soul, together with the violent opposition I have met with from various quarters, would long since have quite overwhelmed, and at least have prevailed on me to accept some of those offers that have been made me to nestle, by accepting of which I might have screened myself from that obloquy and contempt, which, in some degree or other, every day I have the honour to meet with for <span
      class="smcap">Jesu</span>’s
    sake. But hitherto having obtained help from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    without eating a morsel of the church of <i>England</i>’s bread, I still continue to use her liturgy, wherever a church or chapel is allowed me, and preach up her articles, and enforce her homilies. Your Lordship therefore judgeth exceeding right, when you say, “I presume you do not mean to declare any dissent from the church of <i>England</i>.”—Far be it from me; no, my Lord, unless thrust out, I shall never leave her, and even then (as I hope whenever it happens it will be an unjust extrusion) I shall still continue to adhere to her doctrines, and pray for the much wished-for restoration of her discipline, even to my dying day. Fond of displaying her truly protestant and orthodox principles, especially when church and state are in danger from a cruel and popish enemy, I am glad, my Lord, of an opportunity of preaching, though it should be in a meeting-house; and I think it discovers a good and moderate spirit in the Dissenters, who will quietly attend on the church service, as many have done, and continue to do at <i>Long-Acre</i> chapel, while many, who I suppose stile themselves her faithful sons, by very improper instruments of
    reformation, have endeavoured to disturb and molest us. If the lessor of this chapel, my Lord, hath no power to let it out, or if it be not legally and properly licensed, I have been deceived indeed; and if upon enquiry I find this to be the case, I shall soon declare in the most public manner, how both your Lordship and myself have been imposed upon. But if it appears, that the lessor hath a right to dispose of his own property, and that the place is licensed, if not in the court books of the Quarter Sessions, yet in the Commons or some other proper court; and as some good, I trust, has
    <a id="p161"></a>been, and hope will yet be done by this foolishness of preaching, surely your Lordship’s candour will overlook a little irregularity; since I fear that in these dregs of time, these last days, wherein we live, we must be obliged to be irregular, or in short we must do no good at all. My Lord, I remember well, (and O that I may more than ever obey your Lordship’s admonition) and often recollect that awful day wherein I was ordained priest, and when authority was given me, by my honoured friend and father good Bishop <i>Benson</i>, to preach the word of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    O that the glorious exhortation, which he delivered with so much solemnity, may be written upon the tables of my heart! Mindful of this, I shall be always ready to go out, and seek for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sheep that are dispersed abroad, and be willing to spend and be spent for the good of his children which are in the midst of this naughty world. Never did I so much as dream, my Lord, that this was only a local commission, or that the condition annexed, “Where you shall be lawfully appointed thereunto,” was to confine me to any particular place, and that it would be unlawful for me to preach out of it. It is plain my Lord Bishop of <i>Gloucester</i> did not think so; for when his secretary brought a licence for me, his Lordship said, “It would cost me thirty shillings, and therefore I should not have it.” And when after being presented to the late Bishop of <i>London</i>, I applied to him for a licence, his lordship was pleased to say, “I was going to <i>Georgia</i>, and needed none.” Accordingly I preached in most of the London churches under his Lordship’s immediate inspection; and why any other licence than my letters of orders should now be required, I believe no substantial, I am positive no truly scriptural, reason can be assigned. It is true, as your Lordship observes, there is one canon that says, “That no curate or minister shall be permitted to serve in any place, without examination and admission of the Bishop of
    the diocese.” And there is another also, as quoted by your Lordship, which tells us, “That neither minister, church-wardens, nor any other officers of the church, shall suffer any man to preach within their chapels, but such as, by shewing their licence to preach, shall appear unto them to be sufficiently authorized thereunto.” But, my Lord, what curacy or parsonage have I desired, or do I desire to be admitted to
    <a id="p162"></a>serve in? Or into what church or chapel do I attempt to intrude myself, without leave from the churchwardens or other officers? No, my Lord, being, as I think, without cause denied admission into the churches, I am content to take the field, and when the weather will permit, with a table for my pulpit, and the heavens, for my sounding-board, I desire to proclaim to all, the unsearchable riches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ.</span>
    Besides, my Lord, if this canon should be always put into full execution, I humbly presume, that no bishop or presbyter can legally preach at any time out of the diocese in which he is appointed to serve; consequently no city incumbent can even occasionally be lawfully assisted by any country clergyman, or even a bishop himself be lawfully permitted to preach a charity sermon out of his own diocese, without a special licence for so doing. And what a loss would that be to many noble charities here in town? As for that other canon which your Lordship mentions, and which runs thus, “Neither shall any minister, not licensed as is aforesaid, presume to appoint or hold any meetings for sermons, commonly termed by some, prophecies or exercises, in market towns or other places, under the said pains.” I need not inform your Lordship, that it was originally levelled against those who would not conform to the church of <i>England</i>, and that too in such high flying times, which I cannot believe any one of the present moderate bench of bishops would wish to see again restored. And if this be the true state of the case, how, my Lord, doth this canon belong to me, who am episcopally ordained, and have very lately published a small tract (which I humbly beg your Lordship’s acceptance of) on purpose to recommend the communion office of the church of <i>England</i>? But, my Lord, to come nearer to the point in hand, (and for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake let not your Lordship be offended with my using such plainness of speech) I would, as in the presence of the living <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    put it to your Lordship’s conscience, whether there is one bishop or presbyter in <i>England</i>, <i>Wales</i>, or <i>Ireland</i>, that looks upon our canons as his rule of action? If they do, we are all perjured with a witness, and consequently, in a very bad sense of the word, <i>irregular indeed</i>. May I not, therefore, say on this, alluding to what my blessed Master did on another occasion, “He that is without the sin of acting illegally, if the
    <a id="p163"></a>canons of our church be implicitly to be obeyed, let him cast the first stone at me and welcome.” Your Lordship knows full well, that canons and other church laws are good and obligatory, when conformable to the laws of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and agreeable to the liberties of a free people; but when invented and compiled by men of little hearts and bigotted principles, on purpose to hinder persons of more enlarged souls from doing good, or being more extensively useful, they become mere <i
      lang="la">bruta fulmina</i>;
    and when made use of only as cords to bind up the hands of a zealous few, that honestly appear for their King, their country, and their <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    like the withes with which the <i>Philistines</i> bound <i>Sampson</i>, in my opinion, they may very legally be broken. What pains and penalties are to be incurred for such offence, (as I have not the canons at present before me) I cannot tell; but for my own part, my Lord, if any penalty is incurred, or any pain to be inflicted upon me, for prophesying or preaching against sin, the Pope, and the devil, and for recommending the strictest loyalty to the best of princes, his Majesty King <i>George</i>, in this metropolis, or any other part of his Majesty’s dominions, I trust, through grace, I shall be enabled to say,</p>
  <p class="vm_stanza align_ctr txt_sm">
    <i>All hail reproach, and welcome pain!</i></p>
  <p class="vm_stanza in_00">
    I think there now remains but one more particular in your Lordship’s letter to be answered:—your Lordship’s truly apostolical canon taken out of <i>2 Corinthians <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 16</i>;
    upon turning to, and reading of which, I could not help thinking, my Lord, of a passage I once met with in good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Philip Henry</i>’s life. It was this: Being ejected out of the church, and yet thinking it his duty to preach, he used now and then to give the people of <i>Broad-Oaks</i>, where he lived, a gospel sermon; and one day, as he was coming from his exercise, and meeting with the incumbent, he thus addressed him: “Sir, I have been taking the liberty of throwing a handful of seed into your field.” “Have you so, said the good man? may <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give it his blessing! There is work enough for us both.” This, my Lord, I humbly conceive, is the case not only of your Lordship, but of every minister’s parish in <i>London</i>, and every bishop’s diocese in <i>England</i>; and therefore as good is done, and souls are benefited, I hope your Lordship will not regard a
    <a id="p164"></a>little irregularity, since at the worst, it is only the irregularity of doing well. But supposing this should not be admitted as an excuse at other seasons, I would hope it will have its weight at this critical juncture, wherein, if there were ten thousand sound preachers, and each preacher had a thousand tongues, they could not well be too frequently employed in calling upon the inhabitants of <i>Great-Britain</i> to be upon their guard, against the cruel and malicious designs of <i>France</i>, of <i>Rome</i>, and of hell. After all, my Lord, if your Lordship will be pleased to apply to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i> himself, (who, I suppose, knows where the place is registered) or if upon enquiry I shall find, that the lessor hath no power to let it out, as I hate and abhor every dishonourable action, after my setting out for <i>Bristol</i>, which I expect to do in a few days, I shall decline preaching in the chapel any more. But if the case should appear to be otherwise, I hope your Lordship will not be angry, if I persist in this, I trust not unpardonable, irregularity: for if I decline preaching in every place, meerly because the incumbent may be unwilling I should come into his parish, I fear I must seldom or never preach at all; and this, my Lord, especially at this juncture, when all our civil and religious liberties are as it were at stake, would to me be worse than death itself. I humbly ask pardon for detaining your Lordship so long, but being willing to give your Lordship all the satisfaction I possibly could, I have chosen rather to sit up and deny myself proper repose, than to let your Lordship’s candid letter lie by me one moment longer than was absolutely necessary. I return your Lordship a thousand thanks for your favourable opinion of me, and good wishes, and begging the continuance of your Lordship’s blessing, and earnestly praying, that whenever your Lordship shall be called hence, you may give up your account with joy, I beg leave to subscribe myself, my Lord,</p>

As therefore, your Lordship would undoubtedly chuse that the church liturgy should be read in it sometimes, rather than it should be entirely made use of in a non-conformist way, I hope your Lordship will not be offended, if I go on as usual after my return from <i>Bristol</i>. I assure your Lordship, through the divine blessing, real good hath been done; and therefore I am sorry to inform your Lordship, that notwithstanding the admonitions I hear your Lordship hath given them, some unhappy persons have still endeavoured to disturb us, by making an odd kind of a noise in a neighbouring house. I hear that some of them belong to your Lordship’s vestry, and therefore wish that your Lordship would so far interpose, as to order them once more to stop their proceedings.

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>O my great surprize, upon my coming up to town, I found that the disturbances so justly complained of near <i>Long-Acre</i> chapel, had been continued. On <i>Thursday</i> evening last, when I preached there myself, they were rather increased. Notwithstanding some of the windows were stopped up, to prevent in some degree the congregations being disturbed by the unhallowed noise, yet large stones were thrown in at another window, and one young person badly wounded. This constrains me to trouble your Lordship once more, and to beg the favour of your Lordship so far to interpose, as to desire the persons belonging to your Lordship’s vestry, to desist from such irregular proceedings. For my own irregularity
    <a id="p167"></a>in preaching, I am ready at any time to answer; and was I myself the only sufferer, I should be entirely unconcerned whatever personal ill treatment I might meet with in the way of my duty. But to have the lives of his Majesty’s loyal subjects endangered, when they come peaceably to worship <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and to pray for his long and prosperous reign, is an irregularity, which I am persuaded your Lordship will look upon as unjustifiable in the sight of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and of every good man. However, as a subject to King <i>George</i>, and a minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    I know your Lordship will allow, I have a right to do myself justice, and therefore, I hope, if the disturbances be yet continued, your Lordship will not be offended, if I lay a plain and fair narration of the whole affair, together with what hath passed between your Lordship and myself, before the world. I beg your Lordship not to look upon this as a threatning, or as done with an intent to expose; I scorn any such mean procedure. But as providence seems to point out such a method, I hope your Lordship will have no just reason to censure me, if it be pursued by, my Lord,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> HEARTILY thank your Lordship for your kind acceptance of my three small tracts, and my very long letter dated <i>February</i> <abbr
      title="sixteenth">16th</abbr>.—At
    the same time, I acknowledge myself concerned, that any thing I have written since, should prevent your Lordship’s pointing out to me any mistakes, which I may lie under in regard to the canons. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows, if I do err, it is for want of better information; and therefore if your Lordship will vouchsafe to favour me with the letter prepared for that purpose, it shall be most thankfully received, most impartially examined, most explicitly replied to, but withal never exposed to the view of the world. Your Lordship needed not to inform me of the privilege of a Peer, to deter me from publishing your Lordship’s letters without first asking leave. I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I have not so learned <span

    By his help, nothing shall be done in that way, which is the least inconsistent with the strictest honour, justice and simplicity. But I hope, if a public account of the repeated disturbances at <i>Long-Acre</i> chapel should be rendered necessary, your Lordship will not esteem it unreasonable in me, to inform the world, what previous steps were taken to prevent and stop them. Surely such a scene, at such a juncture, and under such a government, as has been transacted in your Lordship’s parish, in the house or yard of one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Cope</i>, who I hear is your Lordship’s overseer, ever since last <i>Twelfth-Day</i>, I believe is not to be met with in <i>English</i> history. Indeed, my Lord, it is more than noise. It deserves no milder a name than <i>premeditated rioting</i>. Drummers, soldiers, and many of the baser sort, have been hired by subscription.—A copper-furnace, bells, drums, clappers, marrow bones and cleavers, and such like
    <a id="p169"></a>instruments of reformation, have been provided for, and made use of, by them repeatedly, from the moment I have begun preaching, to the end of my sermon. By these horrid noises, many women have been almost frightened to death, and mobbers encouraged thereby to come and riot at the chapel door during the time of divine service, and then insult and abuse me and the congregation after it hath been over. Not content with this, the chapel windows, while I have been preaching, have repeatedly been broken by large stones of almost a pound weight (some now lying by me) which though levelled at, providentially missed me, but at the same time sadly wounded some of my hearers. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>C――</i>, one of your Lordship’s relations, can acquaint your Lordship with many more particulars, and if your Lordship would be so good as only to ride to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>C――</i>’s house, you would see such a scaffold (unless taken down) and such costly preparations for a noise upon it, that must make the ears of all that shall hear it to tingle. Indeed last <i>Tuesday</i> night all was hush’d,—and in order to throw off all popular odium, I gave it as my opinion, that it was owing to your Lordship’s kind interposition. One <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i> and one <abbr

    <i>M――</i>, I am informed, are parties greatly concerned. I know them not, and I pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords never to lay this ill and unmerited treatment to their charge. If no more noise is made on their part, I assure your Lordship no further resentment shall be made on mine. But if they persist, I have the authority of the Apostle on a like occasion, to appeal unto <i>Cæsar</i>.—And thanks be to <span

    we have a <i>Cæsar</i> to appeal to, whose laws will not suffer any of his loyal subjects to be used in such an inhuman manner. I have only one favour to beg of your Lordship, that “you would send (as they are your Lordship’s parishioners) to the above gentlemen, and desire them henceforward to desist from such unchristian (and especially at this critical juncture) such riotous and dangerous proceedings.” Whether as a Chaplain to a most worthy Peeress, a Presbyter of the church of <i>England</i>, and a steady disinterested friend to our present happy constitution, I have not a right to ask such a favour, I leave to your Lordship’s mature deliberation. Henceforward, I hope no more to trouble your Lordship; but committing my cause to him,

I think the awakening, and prospect of doing good in <i>London</i>, is as great as ever. Satan hath raged at a place called <i>Long-Acre</i> chapel, near the play-houses, but you know who hath promised to bruise him under our feet. Send me what good news you can from your side the water, and assure all the followers of the Lamb of <span

    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE my last from <i>Canterbury</i>, I have received two more letters of a like kind with the former. Before they came to hand I was exceedingly comforted, from whence I inferred a further storm lay before me. My greatest distress is, how to act so as to avoid rashness on the one hand, and timidity on the other. I have been introduced to the Earl of <i>H――ss</i>, who received me very courteously, and seemed to make no objection against issuing out a reward for the discovery of the
    <a id="p173"></a>letter-writer. Whether I had best accept it, I know not. Sir <i>H―― C――</i> says, it is not felony; and he advises me by all means to put all concerned into the court of <i>King’s Bench</i>. The facts are most flagrant. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    direct me for thy mercy’s sake! A man came up to me in the pulpit at the tabernacle; <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows, what was his design: I see no other way for me to act, than either resolutely to persist in preaching and prosecuting, or entirely to desist from preaching, which I think would bring intolerable guilt upon my soul, and give the adversary cause to blaspheme. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am clear, quite clear in the occasion of my suffering. It is for preaching <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    and, for his great name’s sake, loyalty to King <i>George</i>, to whom under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    I owe the liberty of preaching many years. Alas! alas! what a condition would this land be in, was the protestant interest not to prevail? Glad should I be to die by the hands of an assassin, if popery is to get footing here. I shall then be taken away from the evil to come. I hope that your Ladyship, and the good Ladies with you, will have hearts given you to pray for me, that, whether by life or by death, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> may be glorified. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, to me to live is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and to die will be my gain. He knows, that with simplicity and godly sincerity, I have endeavoured to promote in my feeble way his honour and glory. I should be glad of a line of advice from your Ladyship; this is giving trouble I no way deserve, but as your Ladyship is pleased to honour me with your friendship, it will be adding to the innumerable obligations already conferred upon, honoured Madam,</p>

    But you will not misimprove it. By <i>Maclellan</i> I hope to hear more particulars. <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">F</span>OR so I must address myself, having had you in a peculiar manner upon my heart, ever since I saw and read a letter that came from you some months ago. It bespoke the language of a heart devoted to the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus.</span> <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i> confirmed me in this opinion yesterday, and withal told me, she believed you would be glad of a line from me, who am indeed less than the least of all saints, but willing, if I know any thing of my own heart, to spend and be spent for the good of souls. They are redeemed by the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whose cross, blessed be his name, hath been made delightful to me for some years. I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that I am cast out for my Master’s sake. Indeed, my very dear Sir, it is preferable to all other preferment whatsoever. It is the way to the crown. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that there are some young champions coming forth: methinks I could now sing my <i
      lang="la">nunc dimittis</i>
    with triumphant joy. Though I decrease, may you, my very dear Sir, increase. O that you may be kept
    <a id="p179"></a>from conferring with flesh and blood! O that you may be owned and blessed of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    I believe you will, and never more so than when you are reviled and despised by man. It is a fatal mistake, to think we must keep our characters in order to do good; this is called <i>prudence</i>; in most, I fear, it is <i>trimming</i>. Honesty I find always to be the best policy. They who honour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    he will honour. Even in this world, if we confess him, his truth, and his people, we shall receive an hundred-fold. To lose all in this respect, is to find all. But whither am I going? Excuse, my very dear Sir, the overflowings of a heart, that loves you dearly for the glorious Redeemer’s sake. I am here preaching his cross, and expect to stay over <i>Sunday</i>. Next week I have thoughts of being at <i>Bath</i> and <i>Westbury</i>. I lead a pilgrim life. You will pray that I may have a pilgrim heart. Ere long I hope my heavenly father will take me home. I am ambitious; I want to sit upon a throne. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath purchased and provided a throne and heaven for me. That you may have an exalted place at his right hand, is and shall be the earnest prayer of, reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first part of your letter made me smile: for what? Because I was glad to find you had such an enlarged heart, and at the same time imagined, that I could build two houses at a time. If the top-stone of one is brought forth, I shall think we have reason to shout unto it, Grace! grace! This I hope will be the happy lot of you and your young fellow-soldiers, in respect to your spiritual building. Remember, war is proclaimed; the sword is unsheathed; the devil, the world, and the flesh will dispute every inch of ground, and you must fight or die. Angels stand by to see the combat, and <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    stands ready to make you more than conquerors through his love. Provoke then one another, but let it be to love and to good works. Take heed of a trifling spirit when

    disappoints. In hopes of seeing your Ladyship, I hastened to <i>Bristol</i>, but found your Ladyship had been in <i>London</i> whilst I was there. Sorry was I for the occasion of your Ladyship’s journey, and yet glad to hear that Master <i>H――</i> was so well recovered. At <i>Bristol</i> the Redeemer caused us to triumph, and likewise in <i>Gloucestershire</i>, at <i>Bradford</i>, <i>Frome</i>, <i>Warminster</i>, and at <i>Portsmouth</i>, whither I have been these three weeks last past. I am now come up for about ten days to keep Pentecost; I trust it will be a Pentecost to many souls at <i>Long-Acre</i>. Blessed be <span

    a new building is now erecting at <i>Tottenham-Court Road</i>: <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>J――</i> promises to assist me. We have consulted the Commons, about putting it under your Ladyship’s protection. This is the answer: “No nobleman can licence a chapel, or in any manner have one put in his dwelling house; that the chapel must be a private one, and not with doors to the street for any persons to resort to at pleasure, for then it becomes a public one; that a chapel cannot be built and used as such, without the consent of the parson of the parish, and when it is done with his consent, no minister can preach therein, without licence of the Bishop of the diocese.” There seems then to be but one way,—to licence it as our other houses are: and thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    for that liberty which we have. O that I could begin to work while it is day. My <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    half the year gone, and so little, yea very little done for thee! I have need of being purged, that I may at length bring forth some fruit unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Glory be to his great name, he doth not say, “Let him alone.” Outward and inward trials frequently surround me; but, by the help of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I shall leap over every wall. I know your Ladyship will not forget to pray for me. My poor prayers are always offered up for

I see your Ladyship is touched in a very tender point: generous minds are always thus affected, when a friend is abused. But I find more and more, honoured Madam, that our own mother’s children will be permitted to be angry with one. The contradiction of saints, is more trying than that of sinners:—but it is all to teach us to cease from man, and wrap ourselves in Him, in whom alone dwells consummate perfection. That I might say, “some of <abbr

    <i>L――</i> knows too much of the divine life, not to see some call even in this cross; and I hope your Ladyship will not suffer it to burden your mind any longer. Satan wants to disturb your Ladyship’s repose. Ere long, blessed be the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, he will be bruised under our feet. This last week I have had some respite from his artful and perplexing suggestions, and have been enabled to ride upon my high places. My present work at <i>London</i> seems to be over, and <i>Monday</i> or <i>Tuesday</i> next, <span

To thee, and thee alone, most adorable Redeemer, be all the glory! Want of strength forbids my enlarging. O this vile body! Surely our treasure is in earthly vessels.

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR Ladyship’s kind letter found me just returned from <i>Bristol</i>, and just setting out for <i>Maidstone</i> and <i>Chatham</i>, where I have been to preach the gospel, and to visit a poor murderer. I hope that my poor feeble labours were not altogether in vain in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    A divine influence accompanies the word preached here, and I am now preparing for my northern expedition. If your Ladyship removes not from <i>Donnington</i> soon, perhaps I may have the honour of waiting upon your Ladyship there. My motions must be very quick, because I would hasten to <i>Scotland</i> as fast as possible, to have more time at my return. Eternity! eternity! O how do I long for thee! But alas, how often must we be like pelicans in the wilderness, before we arrive there? Solitariness prepares for the social life, and the social life for solitariness again. Thus doth an all-wise Redeemer set one over against another. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is the alone center of peace and comfort in either situation. Your Ladyship knows this by happy experience. Perhaps our consolations come sweetest, when immediately derived from the fountain head. Springs fail, the fountain never can nor will. That your Ladyship may every moment be refreshed with its living waters, is and shall be the earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,</p>

    <i>Honoured and very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">H</span>OW swiftly doth my precious time fly away! It is now a fortnight since I came to <i>Leeds</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>, where the gospel had indeed free course, did run, and was glorified. On the <i>Sunday</i> evening, a few hours after my arrival, many thousands were gathered in the fields, to whom, I trust, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    enabled me to speak with some degree of power. The following week I preached in and about <i>Leeds</i>, thrice almost every day, to thronged and affected auditories; and on <i>Sunday</i> last the fields were indeed white ready unto harvest. At <i>Bradford</i>, about seven in the morning, the auditory consisted of about
    <a id="p189"></a>ten thousand; at noon, and in the evening at <i>Burstall</i>, to near double the number. Though hoarse, the Redeemer helped me to speak, so that all heard. Upon every account it was a high-day. In the evening several hundreds of us rode about eight miles, singing and praising <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Indeed it was a night much to be remembered. The next morning I took a sorrowful leave of <i>Leeds</i>, preached at <i>Tadcaster</i> at noon, and at <i>York</i> the same night. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was with us. On <i>Tuesday</i> I preached twice at <i>York</i> (delightful seasons!); on <i>Wednesday</i> at <i>Warstall</i>, about fifty miles off; on <i>Thursday</i> twice at <i>Yarm</i>, and last night and this morning here. All the way I have heard of a great concern since I was in these parts last year, and of many glorious trophies of the power of redeeming love. In heaven, honoured Sir, you will know all. There I shall throw my crown before the Lamb, and there you shall be rewarded for strengthening the hands of the most unworthy creature that ever was employed by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    After spending my sabbath here, and visiting <i>Shields</i>, <i>Newcastle</i>, and some adjacent places, I purpose to go on to <i>Scotland</i>. From thence I hope to have the honour of writing to you again. This is the first time I have had a proper opportunity of refreshing myself in that way. Praying that you may increase with all the increase of <span

    and begging your acceptance of repeated thanks for repeated unmerited favours, I subscribe myself, honoured and very dear Sir,</p>

    what am I? Help me, glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, to abhor myself in dust and ashes! He will bless you, dear Madam, for what you have done. O that I had a thousand lives to employ in his service! I am much obliged to dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i>. Neither she nor you will have reason to repent your zeal on this occasion. It will be much for the Mediator’s glory, and the welfare, I hope, of thousands of souls, to have every thing honourably discharged. I know I shall have your prayers, dear Madam, and I am sure you have mine. O that you may know in whom you have believed! Come, dear Madam, be not discouraged; you know who hath said, “then shall ye know, if ye follow on to know the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.”
    I could enlarge, but it is near six in the morning, and I must away to preach. O that my blessed Master may never turn me out of that divine employ! I hope my most grateful respects and acknowledgments will find acceptance with dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>

I take this method, being assured that you will excuse the liberty I take to ask you one question, How I can be convinced that my past sins are to be forgiven? And O, what must I do to be saved! My sins are innumerable. <span

A want of this, I fear, hath led the Count into all his mistakes. With great regret I speak or write of any people’s weaknesses; but I did and do now think, that divine Providence called me to publish what you mention. The Redeemer gave it his blessing. I do not find that their fopperies are continued, and I hear also that they have discharged many debts. You seem to have right notions of the sermon to which you refer. It certainly speaks of a sinless state, which is not attainable in this life. We are called to be saints, but not angels.

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    do thou continue to wash us in thy blood, and cloathe us with thy compleat and everlasting righteousness; and at the same time, out of a principle of love to thee, do thou help us to follow hard after that holiness, without which no man can see the <span

    whither am I going? My very dear Sir, excuse prolixity. I write to you, as to one whom I love in the bowels of <span

    I came thither the twelfth of <i>May</i>, and left it the sixth of <i>June</i>, and preached just fifty
    <a id="p204"></a>times. To what purpose, the great day will discover. I have reason to believe to very good purpose. Being the time of the general assembly (at which I was much pleased) many ministers attended, perhaps a hundred at a time. Thereby prejudices were removed, and many of their hearts were deeply impressed. About thirty of them, as a token of respect, invited me to a public entertainment. The Lord High Commissioner also invited me to his table, and many persons of credit and religion did the same in a public manner. Thousands and thousands, among whom were a great many of the best rank, daily attended on the word preached, and the longer I staid, the more the congregations and divine influence increased. Twice I preached in my way to <i>Glasgow</i>, and last night opened my campaign here. The cloud seems to move towards <i>Ireland</i>. How the Redeemer vouchsafes to deal with me there, you shall know hereafter. In the mean while, my very dear friend, let me entreat the continuance of your prayers.

I doubt not but you are brightening your crown, and increasing your reward, by doing good for your blessed Master. Ere long, you shall hear him say “Well done.” That will crown all.

    instant, I just now received, for which as well as all other favours be pleased to accept unfeigned thanks.—What to do I cannot well tell.—As I am in the kingdom, it is pity to leave it unvisited.—The door is open, and indeed the poor Methodists want help.—Here in <i>Dublin</i> the congregations are very large, and very much impressed. The Redeemer vouchsafes to give me great freedom in preaching, and arrows of conviction fly and fasten.—One of the Bishops told a nobleman, “He was glad I was come to rouse the people”—The nobleman, with whom I sweetly conversed yesterday, told me this again.—<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    do thou (for it is thy doing) rouse all ranks for thy mercy’s sake! I hope <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>M――n</i> will go on and prosper.—As for <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>J――s</i>, I think it best for him to keep as he is.—I find he is unsettled, and therefore would be always uneasy.—If <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr>
    <i>D――s</i> and <i>D――r</i> can serve alternately in the Summer, by the help of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    I will go through the Winter work.—Alas, that so few have the ambition of coming out to the help of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    against the mighty. Not one clergyman in all <i>Ireland</i> yet stirred up to come out <i>singularly</i> for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>! Pity, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, for thy mercy’s sake! I think <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will yet appear for the protestant interest.—My rout now is to <i>Athlone</i>, <i>Limerick</i>, <i>Cork</i>, and to return here about <i>July 21</i>.—Whether I shall then go to the North, and to <i>Scotland</i>, or whether I shall come by way of <i>Park-Gate</i>, must be determined hereafter.—I know you will pray, my very dear Sir, that the never-failing <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will direct my goings in his way. I would fain be where and what he would have me to be.—I bless him, for making you, my very dear Sir, instrumental in strengthening my weak hands, and earnestly pray, that great may be the reward of you and your dear relations in the kingdom of heaven.—Assure yourselves you or they are never forgotten by, my very dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Dublin, July 9, 1757.</i></p>
  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY attacks have I had from Satan’s children, but yesterday, you would have thought he had been permitted to have given me an effectual parting blow. You have heard of my being in <i>Ireland</i>, and of my preaching daily to large and very affected auditories, in <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――</i>’s spacious room. When here last, I preached in a more confined place in the week days, and once or twice ventured out to <i>Oxminton-Green</i>, a large place like <i>Moorfields</i>, situated very near the barracks, where the <i>Ormond and Liberty</i>, that is, <i>high and low party boys</i>, generally assemble every <i>Sunday</i>, to fight with each other. The congregations then were very numerous, the word seemed to come with power; and no noise or disturbance ensued. This encouraged me to give notice, that I would preach there again last <i>Sunday</i> afternoon. I went through the barracks, the door of which opens into the green, and pitched my tent near the barrack walls, not doubting of the protection, or at least interposition of the officers and soldiery, if there should be occasion. But how vain is the help of man! Vast was the multitude that attended; we sang, prayed, and preached, without much molestation; only now and then a few stones and clods of dirt were thrown at me. It being war time, as is my usual practice, I exhorted my hearers not only to fear <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    but to honour the best of kings, and after sermon I prayed for success to the <i>Prusian arms</i>. All being over, I thought to return home the way I came; but to my great surprize access was denied, so that I had to go near half a mile from one end of the green to the other, through hundreds and hundreds of papists, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    Finding me unattended, (for a soldier and four methodist preachers, who came with me, had forsook me and fled) I was left to their mercy; but their mercy, as you may easily guess, was perfect cruelty. Vollies of hard stones came from all quarters, and every step I took, a fresh stone struck, and made me reel backwards and forwards, till I was almost breathless, and all over a gore of blood. My strong beaver hat served me as it were for a scull
    <a id="p208"></a>cap for a while; but at last that was knocked off, and my head left quite defenceless. I received many blows and wounds; one was particularly large and near my temples. I thought of <i>Stephen</i>, and as I believed that I received more blows, I was in great hopes that like him I should be dispatched, and go off in this bloody triumph to the immediate presence of my master. But providentially, a minister’s house lay next door to the green; with great difficulty I staggered to the door, which was kindly opened to, and shut upon me. Some of the mob in the mean time having broke part of the boards of the pulpit into large splinters, they beat and wounded my servant grievously in his head and arms, and then came and drove him from the door. For a while I continued speechless, panting for and expelling every breath to be my last; two or three of the hearers, my friends, by some means or other got admission, and kindly with weeping eyes washed my bloody wounds, and gave me something to smell to and to drink. I gradually revived, but soon found the lady of the house desired my absence, for fear the house should be pulled down. What to do, I knew not, being near two miles from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――</i>’s place; some advised one thing, and some another. At length, a carpenter, one of the friends that came in, offered me his wig and coat, that I might go off in disguise. I accepted of, and put them on, but was soon ashamed of not trusting my master to secure me in my proper habit, and threw them off with disdain. I determined to go out (since I found my presence was so troublesome) in my proper habit; immediately deliverance came. A methodist preacher, with two friends, brought a coach; I leaped into it, and rid in gospel triumph through the oaths, curses, and imprecations of whole streets of papists unhurt, though threatened every step of the ground. None but those who were spectators of the scene, can form an idea of the affection with which I was received by the weeping, mourning, but now joyful methodists. A christian surgeon was ready to dress our wounds, which being done, I went into the preaching place, and after giving a word of exhortation, join’d in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving, to him who makes our extremity his opportunity, who stills the noise of the waves, and the madness of the most malignant people. The next morning I set out for port <i>Arlington</i>,
    <a id="p209"></a>and left my persecutors to his mercy, who out of persecutors hath often made preachers. That I may be thus revenged of them, is the hearty prayer of,</p>

    <i>Reverend and very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> THANK you for your sympathizing letter sent to <i>Ireland</i>. The friend of sinners stood by me, or I had been stoned to death. They were thrown at me, not for speaking against the Papists in particular, but for exciting all ranks to be faithful to King <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and to our dear sovereign King <i>George</i>, for his great name’s sake. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what am I, that I should be honoured to suffer any degree of pain or shame in such a cause? Time will not permit me to descend to more particulars. A young man, who will bring you soon a few lines from me, can tell you the whole affair. He is a Methodist, and is coming from <i>Dublin</i>, (and from a Bishop’s family) to study
    <a id="p214"></a>at <i>Glasgow</i>. I know you will receive him gladly. O that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may qualify, and send forth thousands to blow the trumpet in <i>Zion</i>! Seven gospel ministers were together at <i>Bristol</i>, when the counsellor preached. A lawyer hath lately entered likewise into orders, and I humbly hope the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will not give us up. Both at home and abroad we are in great danger. But the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    lives, and will live and reign for ever. The awakenings in <i>New-Jersey</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> are tokens for good. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    prepare us for whatever thou hast prepared for us! We have had blessed seasons for these six weeks last past, at <i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Exeter</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, and <i>Gloucestershire</i>. This comes from my winter quarters. You will pray, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> BURNT, but I believe I shall never forget the contents of, your Ladyship’s letter. Who but the Redeemer himself, can possibly describe the yearnings of such a tender parent’s heart? Surely your Ladyship is called to cut off a right hand, and pluck out a right eye; “But it is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    let him do what seemeth him good,” This was the language of <i>Eli</i>, whose sons were sinners before the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    exceedingly. This hath often been the case of the best of people, and the greatest favourites of heaven; but none knows the bitterness of such a cup, but those who are called to drink it. If not sweetened with a sense of the love and mercy of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    who could abide it? O what physic, what strong physic do our strong affections oblige our heavenly Father to give us! What pruning knives do these luxuriant branches require, in order to preserve the fruit and delicacy of the vine. Blessed be <span

    there is a time coming, when these mysterious dignified providences shall be explained. I am glad <abbr

O for warm winter quarters! O that I could bear part of your Ladyship’s heavy load! But I can only in my feeble way bear it on my heart, before him who came to heal our sicknesses and bear our infirmities. That your Ladyship may come out of these fiery trials, purged and purified like the brightest gold, is the earnest prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,</p>

Spiritual routs are blessed entertainments. I must prepare for my throne. It is near five in the evening, and to-morrow I am to preach thrice. <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE event only can prove, whether what I am going to mention, is of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Blessed be his holy name, by new-year’s day I hope we shall be able to discharge our chapel debts. Every day proves more and more that it was built for the glory of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and the welfare of many precious and immortal souls. But my attendance on that, and the Tabernacle too, with a weak body, outward cares, and inward trials, have frequently brought me of late to the apprehensions of being near my wished-for port; but I am afraid I must keep out at sea some time longer. However, I am brought to the short allowance of preaching but once a day, and thrice on a <i>Sunday</i>. O that this feeble carcase could hold out more for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    I want to begin to begin to do something for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I shall be glad if he is pleased to bring our present design to a prosperous issue. You must know then, dear Madam, that round the chapel there is a most beautiful spot of ground, and some good folks have purposed erecting alms-houses on each side, for some godly widows. I have a plan for twelve. The whole expence will be four hundred pounds: we have got one hundred. The widows are to have half-a-crown a week. The sacrament money, which will more than do, is to be devoted to this purpose. Thus will many godly widows be provided for, and a standing monument left, that the Methodists were not against good works. I beg you’ll mention this to good Lady <i>C――</i> and <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>G――</i>; for I would not have it public till the sum is raised, and we are sure of effecting the thing. If I did not know, dear Madam, your benevolent, disinterested heart, I should not thus make free. Be pleased to excuse, if you do not approve the motion. I only mention it, because I believe such a thing would much promote the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I leave this and all with him. I commit you and good Lady <i>C――</i> to his protection, and beg a continued remembrance in your prayers, in behalf of, dear Madam,</p>

    hath promised it shall be given to them. I shall be glad to hear of their success. Ah, my dear man, little do we think, when we first set out, what trials we shall meet with ere we arrive at our journey’s end. I find more and more, that I am a mere novice in the divine life, and have scarce begun to begin to learn my A B C in the school of <span

    I am what I am. He hath helped out of six, and will also help out of seven troubles. I find you have heard of the <i>Irish</i> expedition. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what am I, that I should be counted worthy to suffer shame for thy great name’s sake! A more effectual door than ever seems
    <a id="p226"></a>to be opening in this metropolis. A counsellor, lately ordained, turns out a <i>Boanerges</i>. Thousands and thousands flock to hear the everlasting gospel. The new chapel, where I now write, turns out quite well. The <span

    hath made it a gate of heaven to many souls. This, with the signal deliverances lately vouchsafed the protestant arms, makes me hope that our extremity will yet be <span

    <i>Z――</i>) you have been pleased to make from time to time of me, together with the importunities of that venerable man of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    have at length prevailed upon me to trouble you with this letter. O that an infinitely condescending Redeemer may excite you thereby, most honoured Sir, to be instant in prayer for one who is the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints. Long, long before now did I think of entering into my wish’d-for rest. Times without number hath this tabernacle groaned; but having obtained help from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I yet continue, in my poor way, to preach to all that are willing to hear, the unsearchable riches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Through grace the fields are as yet white, and as ready to harvest as ever. In the Summer I range, and with a table for my pulpit, and the heavens for my sounding-board, I am enabled generally thrice a day, to call to many thousands to come to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    that they may have life. In the Winter I am confined to this metropolis; but to my great mortification, through continual vomiting, want of rest, and of appetite, I have been reduced for some time to the short allowance of preaching only once a day, except <i>Sundays</i>, when I generally preach thrice. Thousands
    <a id="p230"></a>attend every evening at both ends of the town, and on Lord’s-days many, many go away for want of room. The divine presence is apparently amongst us, and every week produces fresh instances of the power of converting grace. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we meet with no disturbances in town, and very seldom in the country: but last year, while I was preaching in the fields in <i>Ireland</i>, a popish mob was so incensed at my preaching the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    <i>our Righteousness</i>, and praying for our good old King, and the King of <i>Prussia</i>, that they surrounded, stoned, and almost killed me. But we are immortal till our work is done, and glad should I have been to have died in such a cause. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――y</i> hath societies in <i>Ireland</i> and elsewhere; and though we differ a little in some principles, yet brotherly love continues. I generally, when itinerating, preach among his people, as freely as among those who are called our own. In <i>London</i> several new flaming preachers are come forth; and in various parts of the kingdom we hear of divers others, who seem determined to know and preach nothing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and him crucified. Thousands and thousands are now praying daily for success to the <i>Prussian</i> and <i>Hanoverian</i> arms. Your fast-days were kept here with great solemnity, and will be so again, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

My very dear Sir, add to my obligations, by following me with your prayers. This tabernacle makes me to groan. The one-horse chaise will not do for me. As it will not quarter I am shaken to pieces.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> THANK you most heartily for your kind letter of invitation to <i>G――</i>. But alas! what shall I say?—I fear it cannot be complied with. For above these three months last past, I have been so weak in my animal frame, that I can scarcely drag the crazy load along. With great difficulty I came here, and if I should stay to come westward, it would make my journey to <i>London</i> too far in the year, as I have many places to call upon in the way. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the work prospers in <i>London</i> more than ever. I am strengthened to preach here twice a day; but alas, I grow weaker and weaker in preaching, and in all I do for the ever-loving and altogether lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I suppose you have heard of the death of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Jonathan Edwards</i>.—Happy he!—You will add to my obligations, by continuing to pray, that the divine strength may be magnified in my weakness, and that I may speedily (if it be the divine will) be sent for to my wished-for heaven!—Praying that we may have a happy meeting there, with ten thousand thanks for all past unmerited kindnesses, I subscribe myself, very dear friends,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">N</span>OT till last <i>Saturday</i>, did your first long wished-for letter come to hand. I wonder that <i>I―― C――</i> did not dispatch it immediately. As I knew not what its contents would be, I did not write to <i>Staffordshire</i>; for I was and am determined to fix upon nothing without advising with you. And indeed, I think the whole must be put off till we can have a free conference. In the mean while, I shall write to our young friend, and pray that the friend of all would direct in this important affair. He will, he will. It is not with <abbr

    <i>S――</i> as you imagine. He is quite free. But more of this when we meet.—<i>When we meet!</i> strange words for a dying man!—But it seems I am growing better. Within these four days I have felt a great alteration.—Perhaps it may continue. <span

I was then appointed by Providence to stay at <i>Edinburgh</i> the race week: since then, I have been at <i>Glasgow</i>, and returned to <i>Edinburgh</i> again. At both places my health grew better, and I was enabled to preach always twice, and sometimes thrice a day, to very large and affected auditories. The partings from both places were very cutting. In heaven all this will be over. In my way to <i>Newcastle</i> I preached twice; and thrice in and about that place.

Surely he will richly reward you, who have left your kindred and native country, and carefully watched over so many infant lambs in that new world. I can only send you my most grateful acknowledgments, and pray continually, “that as your day is, so your strength may be.” Do send me your thoughts about every thing. It seems by <abbr

    <i>Dear <abbr title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> C――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE bearers of this are well known to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>D――n</i>. I trust, I can recommend them as the followers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I wish <i>Bethesda</i> may be a comfortable asylum for them. I think that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>S――k</i>, for the present, might be employed about the lands round the orphan-house, and so gradually learn to be overseer at <i>Ephrata</i>. <i>John H――y</i>, I suppose, will be for moving in a year or two. I wish he may be capable to do for himself. I am told that he drinks; but I do not love to catch at ill reports against those that are employed in my house. Pray let me hear particularly concerning him. <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>S――k</i> is a quiet teachable woman. I think she might be of service to you immediately, and with her husband do quite well, in a short time, at the plantation. You will soon be able to judge. If ―― doth not turn out as you desire, and is not of use in the house, let her be put out to some good service: she is capable now of doing for herself. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>D――n</i> will be so kind as to take care of the little boy. He is quite an orphan, and I am told very quiet, and willing to learn. Would to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    I was coming with them. But the way at present is quite blocked up. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    open it in thy due time! I hope you do not so much as think of seeing <i>England</i> till I come over. <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>S――k</i> hath directions to leave <i>Bethesda</i>, if you think her coming any reason for your remove; that would grieve me to the heart. I think myself quite happy in such an assistant, and hope, now all debts are paid, you will be free from many burdens. O what hath <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    wrought? wonders, wonders! Praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O our souls! I should be glad of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>P――l</i> at <i>Bethesda</i>; but I can give him no more power than he hath. All are against my giving up my trust to any person whatsoever. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    continue to be <i>Bethesda</i>’s <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Should not <i>H――y</i>’s daughter be put out to service. Orphan-house plants ought to be transplanted, to make room for others, and then the family will not be too
    <a id="p257"></a>large. I commit you, and all, to his never failing mercy, and am, dear <abbr

    hath made the ship a <i>Bethel</i>, and I enjoyed that quietness which I have in vain sought after for some years on shore. Not an oath to be heard even in the greatest hurry. All hath been harmony and love. But my breath is short, and I have little hopes, since my late relapse, of much further public usefulness. A few exertions, like the last struggles of a dying man, or glimmering flashes of a taper just burning out, is all that can be expected from me. But blessed be <span

    the taper will be lighted up again in heaven. The sun, when setting here, only sets to rise in another clime. Such is the death of all <span

Why should we not rather by faith be looking through the windows of mortality, and daily crying, “Why are his chariot wheels so long in coming?” We had need of patience, especially when the evil days of sickness and declining age come. But we serve a Master who will not forsake his servants when grey headed. When heart and flesh fail, <span

      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    let it be in inward heart-holiness, that we may daily ripen for the full enjoyment of thyself in heaven! I know who says, <i>Amen</i>; I add <i>Amen</i>, and <i>Amen</i>! and so subscribe myself, with ten thousand thanks for all favours, my dear friends,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> FULLY purposed to write to you before my embarkation for <i>America</i>, but sickness prevented. However, I dearly love you, and often remember you before his throne, who I am persuaded hath loved and given himself for you. This he hath told you, and assured you of again and again by his blessed word and Spirit. Be not therefore faithless, but believing. O that this may find you rejoicing with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory. It leaves me longing for that blissful state, where sorrow and sighing will flee away. There, there shall we meet, and in spite of all the suggestions of Satan, and the desperate wickedness of our own deceitful hearts, ere long join in singing the song of <i>Moses</i> and the Lamb. Faithful is he that hath promised, who also will do it. Last night, but not till then, we cast anchor after near a twelve weeks passage. The last six weeks were very trying to my shattered bark. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is All in All. Help, help to praise him. To his infinite and never-failing mercy do I commend you, as being, for his great name’s sake, my dear <abbr

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may so fill the Tabernacle, that all who come to hear the word, may be constrained to say, “Surely <span

      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that I have been dealt with so bountifully. For some weeks I was enabled to preach once a day when in <i>Scotland</i>, and I trust not without some divine efficacy. But my late disorder kept me silent for some weeks afterwards, and put me upon thinking sometimes, that my intended voyage would be retarded, at least for one year longer. Having obtained a little more bodily strength, I ventured upon the mighty waters, and thanks, eternal thanks to a never-failing Redeemer, I have not been laid by an hour through sickness since I came on board. Every thing hath been providentially ordered, suitable to my low estate. A large and commodious cabbin, a kind Captain, and a most orderly and quiet ship’s company, who gladly attended when I had breath to preach. Scarce an oath have I heard upon deck, during a twelve weeks voyage; and such a stillness through the whole ship, both on week days and the Lord’s-day, as hath from time to time surprized me. Some concern hath appeared, but of what kind or duration the event alone can discover. The spiritual bread hath been cast on the waters: who knows but it may be found after many days. How it shall please my all-bountiful Master to dispose of me when I get on shore, you shall know hereafter. All that I can say is, (if I know any thing of my unspeakably deceitful, and desperately wicked heart) <span

    extended towards me since my departure from <i>London</i>. Surely it was trying, to leave so many at each end of the town, who, I hope, will be my joy and crown of rejoicing in the great day. Indeed, after being taken ill of my old disorder at <i>Edinburgh</i>, and remaining near six weeks silent in <i>Scotland</i>, I thought of seeing you soon again: but having obtained help, I embarked, for the eleventh time, in the ship <i>Fanny</i>; and though we have had a long and trying, yet, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it hath not been an unprofitable voyage. Often, often have I thought of my dear <i>London</i> friends, when I guessed they were assembled together; and as often prayed, when I knew they were retired to rest, that he that keepeth <i>Israel</i>, and neither slumbereth nor sleepeth, would watch over them, and make their very dreams devout. How I am to be disposed of when on dry land, is best known to Him whose I am, and whom I desire to serve in preaching the gospel of his dear Son. Had I strength equal to my will, I could
    <a id="p297"></a>fly from pole to pole. Though wearied, and now almost worn out, indeed and indeed I am not weary of my blessed Master’s service. O love him, love him, for he is a good Master, and doth not leave us when our strength faileth. Make him your portion, and he will be your confidence for ever. According to my present views, if able to do any thing for you, through his leave I hope to see you again next year. In the mean while, as long as I have breath to draw, it shall be my heart’s desire and prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the labours of the dear servants of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    who are called to preach amongst you, may be so blessed and owned from above, that I may not be missed a single moment. May they, may you increase with all the increase, till you are all filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    When near his throne, if there be any consolation in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercies, pray that the same blessing may be conferred, my dear fellow-labourers, my dear <i>Tottenham-Court</i> hearers, on</p>

I would only observe in general, that I would have the family lessened as much as may be, and all things contracted into as small a compass as possible. And now once more adieu, though I trust but for a short season. My heart is too full to enlarge. I have not got the account of the children taken in since the first institution; it is left I believe in <i>New-England</i>. I purpose going thither now from the southward.

    I am enabled to preach thrice a week. But such a flocking of all ranks, I never before saw at <i>New-York</i>. A great number have been to see me, and several come to me in the evening, as it should seem, to hear something of the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    My stay here is undetermined. Perhaps it may be till <i>Christmas</i>. Many thanks are due to my <i>London</i> friends, for their kind assistance, from time to time, in carrying on outward matters, and particularly to those who were so ready to assist in compleating the tabernacle job in such an honourable way. All with you will continue to pray for me. I would write more, but amidst such a throng of company and bodily weakness, it is indeed impracticable.

I think you and yours are not forgotten by them, neither I believe are forgotten by the Friend of all. He remembers us, though he is advanced to so great a kingdom; remembers us in our low estate, and remembers that we are but dust. What a blessing this to worthless, ill and hell-deserving me! What a mercy, to meet with such a friend in the latter stages of our road! Surely he is altogether lovely. Having loved his own, he loves them to the end; witness his yet continuing to own the feeble labours of an almost worn out pilgrim. Every day the thirst for hearing the word increases, and the better sort come home to hear more of it. I must now go soon to <i>New-England</i>.

Some said it was like old times. Prejudices in this place have most strangely subsided. The better sort flock as eagerly as the common people, and are fond of coming for private gospel conversation. This is all of grace. O for an humble and thankful heart! Perhaps I may soon go to <i>Boston</i>. I know you will pray that the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> may accompany me in all my removes.

    <i>D――t</i>, dated in <i>December</i>, that my friends had heard from me more than once, I was in hopes of receiving a few lines from you by the last <i>New-York</i> packet. But I suppose you thought I was gone to the southward. Providence shut up my way: I believe for wise reasons. The inclosed will let you see how matters went at <i>New-York</i>. Since leaving that place, a sweet influence hath attended the word at <i>Easthampton</i>, <i>Bridgehampton</i>, and <i>South-hold</i> upon <i>Long-Island</i>, at <i>Shelter-Island</i> also, and at <i>New-London</i>, <i>Norwich</i>, and <a
      id="p305a" href="#n_22">♦</a><i>Providence</i>
    on the main land. At <i>Boston</i> I have been received with the usual warmth of affection. Twice have we seen the Redeemer’s stately steps in the great congregation. But as
    <a id="p306"></a>the small-pox is likely to take an universal spread through the town, I purpose making my country tour, and then return to <i>Boston</i> in my way to the southward. Invitations come so thick and fast from every quarter, that I know not what to do. I cannot boast of acquiring much additional bodily strength, any otherwise than as the cool season of the year helps to keep me up. Twice a week is as often as I can with comfort ascend my throne. The Redeemer vouchsafes to speak for himself there, and private conversation is greatly blessed. Thus the taper keeps burning a little longer: when extinguished on earth, it will be removed where it shall burn with uninterrupted lustre in the kingdom of heaven. Till I hear from you, and see what is determined concerning <i>Bethesda</i>, I cannot think of undertaking a long voyage. Sometimes I fear my weakness will never allow me to go on ship-board any more. But I will wait. I will endeavour to watch and pray, and doubt not but I shall hear a voice behind me saying, “This is the way, walk thou in it.” In the mean while, I rejoice to find that dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Davis</i> is come to his winter quarters, and do earnestly pray night and day, that he and all my dear fellow-labourers and hearers may increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Perhaps they may pray me over once more. Whenever the way is clear, I am ready to say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    lo I come.” Tender, most tender love awaits you all. I must not enlarge, lest my affections should overpower this feeble frame. In heaven it will be otherwise. My very dear Sir, farewel. I must away to preach at <i>Charles-Town</i>, a neighbouring town to <i>Boston</i>. Hoping ere long to join with you all in praising <span

    <i>Wheelock</i>’s Indians? Such a promising nursery of future missionaries, I believe was never seen in <i>New-England</i> before: pray encourage it with all your might. I also wish you could give some useful puritanical books to <i>Harvard-college</i> library, lately burnt down. Few perhaps will give such; and yet a collection of that kind is absolutely necessary for future students and poor neighbouring ministers, to whom I find the books belonging to the library are freely lent out from time to time. You will not be angry with me for these hints. I know your ambitious greedy soul: you want to grow richer and richer towards <span

    O that there may be in me such a mind! But my wings are clipped. I can only preach twice or thrice a week with comfort. And yet a wider door than ever is opened all along the continent. A beginning is made in <i>Boston</i>. But as the small-pox is spreading there, I purpose preaching for a while in adjacent places. With what success, you may know hereafter.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> HOPE this will find you safe returned from your summer tour, and laden with the fruit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    everlasting love. You see where this leaves me. Friends have even constrained me to stay here, for fear of running into the Summer’s heat. Hitherto I find the benefit of it. Whatever it is owing to, through mercy, I am much better in health, than I was this time twelvemonth, and can now preach thrice a week to very large auditories without hurt. Every day I hear of some brought under concern; and I trust, whenever I remove, a blessing will be left behind. This is all of grace. To the glorious giver, purchaser, and applier of it, be all the glory. All was well at <i>Georgia</i> in <i>April</i>, and I hope to be carried comfortably through the southern journey that lies before me.</p>

Your enemies are very few, and even they seem to be almost at peace with you. I inclose five prints, which shew what is said of you publicly; but as to private discourse, and secret intercessions, you will willingly and modestly remain ignorant of the one, and, I doubt not, feel sweetly the influences of the other.” I add, even so, <span

    <i>Amen</i>! To crown the expedition, after preaching at <i>New-Haven</i> college, the President came to me, as I was going off in the chaise, and informed me that the students were so deeply impressed by the sermon, that they were gone into the chapel, and earnestly entreated me to give them one more quarter of an hour’s exhortation. Not unto me, O <span

    hath given me great favour in the sight of the governor, council, and assembly. A memorial was presented for an additional grant of lands, consisting of two thousand acres. It was immediately complied with. Both houses addressed the Governor in behalf of the intended college. As warm an answer was given; and I am now putting all in repair, and getting every thing ready for that purpose. Every heart seems to leap for joy, at the prospect of its future utility to this and the neighbouring colonies. The only question now is, whether I should embark directly for <i>England</i>, or take one tour more to the northward? He that holdeth the stars in his right hand, will direct in due time. I am here in delightful winter quarters. Peace and plenty reign at <i>Bethesda</i>. His Excellency dined with me yesterday, and expressed his satisfaction in the warmest terms.

    <span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW days more, and then farewel <i>Bethesda</i>, perhaps for ever. Affairs, as to me, I trust are now brought near a close. The within audit I sent to the G――r. Next day came Lord <i>J. A. G――n</i>, to pay his Excellency a visit. Yesterday morning, they with several other gentlemen favoured me with their company to breakfast. But how was my Lord surprized and delighted! After expressing himself in the strongest terms, he took me aside, and informed me, “that the G――r had shewn him the accompts, by which he found
    <a id="p322"></a>what a great benefactor I had been: that the intended college would be of the utmost utility to this and the neighbouring provinces; that the plan was beautiful, rational, and practicable; and that he was persuaded his M――y would highly approve of, and also favour it, with some peculiar marks of his royal bounty.” At their desire I went to town, and dined with him and the G――r at <i>Savannah</i>. On <i>Tuesday</i> next, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I move towards <i>Charles-Town</i>, leaving all arrears paid off, and some cash in hand, besides the last year’s whole crop of rice, some lumber, the house repaired, painted, furnished with plenty of cloathing, and provision till next crop comes in, and perhaps some for sale. <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr>
    <i>D――n</i>, <i>S――k</i>, and their wives, stay till my successors come to supply their places. Only a few boys will be left, and two of them are intended for the foundation. So that this year they will be getting rather than expending. Near ten, boys and girls, have been put out, and the small-pox hath gone through the house, with the loss of about six negroes and four orphans.

    will do it for me. And now farewel, my beloved <i>Bethesda</i>; surely the most delightfully situated place in all the southern parts of <i>America</i>. I do not forget your dear relations. What a blessed winter have I had! Peace, and love, and harmony, and plenty, reign here. <abbr

We have had but a twenty-eight days passage, in the <i>Hallifax</i> packet, from <i>New-York</i>, which got into <i>Falmouth</i> last <i>Monday</i>. I left the vessel near the <i>Lizard</i>, and by the blunder of a drunken fellow, missed the Post on <i>Monday</i> evening.

    thy will be done! I am very low in body, and as yet undetermined what to do. Perhaps, on the whole, it may be best to come on leisurely, to see if my spirits can be a little recruited. You may write a few lines at a venture to <i>Bristol</i>. dear <abbr

I am glad you find old <i>Jacob</i>’s prophecy to be fulfilling. “To <i>Shiloh</i> shall the gathering of the people be.” Nothing is wanting at <i>Bristol</i>, <i>London</i>, and elsewhere, but labourers full of the first old methodistical spirit. But where to get them is the question. Those that are thus minded, are almost worn out. I would gladly fly to <i>Bristol</i> if I could; but I see that it is best to be here for some time. And indeed, things have always been at such a low ebb, when I have been at <i>Bristol</i>, and matters carried on with so little spirit, that I have generally come mourning away. If a few, such as <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>C――t</i>, would exert themselves steadily, and perseveringly, and proper preachers were sent, something might be done to purpose. But as neither of these things is likely to happen, my expectations are not very much raised. However, the residue of the spirit is in the Redeemer’s hands. Our eyes wait upon Him. From Him, and Him alone, all kinds of salvation do come. Fain would I have you up at <i>London</i> for some time, at this season. <abbr

I want you also to read the letters, and give me leave to comment upon them, as my breath will allow. You may return by way of <i>Bristol</i>, or if <i>Sarah</i> is worse, go from hence. I thank you heartily for making the collections. Never was a cause kept up at such a small expence; “not by might, or by power, but by my spirit, saith the <span

    <i>Reverend and very dear Sir</i>,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">N</span>OT want of love, but of leisure and better health, hath prevented your hearing from me more frequently. I find I cannot do as I have done. But, through infinite, free, and sovereign mercy, I am enabled to ascend my gospel throne three or four times a week, and a glorious influence attends the word. People have indeed a hearing ear, but we want more preachers. I know the continual cry of your heart is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    let thy kingdom come.” The prospect of a large and effectual door opening among the heathen, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, is very promising. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Occum</i>, the <i>Indian</i> preacher, is a settled humble christian. The good and great, with a multitude of a lower degree, heard him preach last week at <i>Tottenham-Court</i> chapel, and felt much of the power and presence of our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>R――n</i> hath preached, and collected a hundred pounds, and I believe seven or eight hundred pounds more are subscribed. The truly noble Lord <i>D――h</i> espouses the cause most heartily, and his Majesty is become a contributor. The King of kings and <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords will bless them for it. O what an honour to be permitted to do or suffer any thing for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> of <i>Nazareth</i>! Indeed
    <a id="p336"></a>and indeed, I want to begin to begin: for hitherto, alas! I have done nothing.</p>

I pray for, though I cannot write to them. Hearty, special love attend my dear host, and his yoke-fellow. If possible they shall hear from me soon. I hope all is well at <i>Cambuslang</i>.

    Fy upon me, fy upon me, fifty-two years old last <i>Saturday</i>; and yet, O loving, ever-loving, altogether lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    how little, yea how very little have I done and suffered for thee! Indeed and indeed, my dear and honoured friends, I am ashamed of myself: I blush and am confounded. To-morrow, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, and <i>Thursday</i> also, with many hundreds more, I intend to take the sacrament upon it, that I will begin to begin to be a christian. Though I long to go to heaven to see my glorious Master, what a poor figure shall I make among the saints, confessors, and martyrs, that surround his throne, without some deeper signatures of his divine impress, without more fears of christian honour. Our truly noble mother in <i>Israel</i>, is come to <i>London</i> full of them. <i
      lang="la">Crescit sub pondere virtus.</i>
    She is come out of her cell, with her face shining again. Happy they who have the honour of her acquaintance! Highly honoured are those ministers, who have the honour of preaching for and serving her. Good and honest and dearly beloved Sir <i>C――s</i>, and all your happy circle, male and female, I am persuaded are of my mind. O this single eye, this disinterested spirit, this freedom from worldly hopes and worldly fears, this flaming zeal, this daring to be singularly good, this holy laudable ambition to lead the van; O it is, what? an heaven upon earth! O for a plerophory of faith! To be filled with the Holy Ghost. This is the grand point. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised that you have it in view! All our lukewarmness, all our timidity, all our backwardness to do good, to spend and be spent for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is all owing to our want of more of that faith, which is the inward, heart-felt, self-evident demonstration of things not seen. But whither am I going? Pardon me, good Sir: I keep you from better company. Praying that all (if you live to be fifty-two) may not be such dwarfs in the divine life as I am, I hasten to subscribe myself, most honoured friends,</p>

    If you write <i>with all deference</i>, let him know that <span

    <a id="p351"></a>term <i>deluded</i> and <i>fanatics</i>, as the excellent ones upon the earth; and that you choose rather to suffer reproach with them, than to enjoy all the pleasures of sense, and all the preferments in the world. But why do I dictate? I trust you to the teachings of that <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    grant it may be a nursery for what he calls <i>fanatics</i> so long as one stone is left upon another. One letter more I imagine will rid you of further trouble from this quarter; expect then attacks from another: but look to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    he will make you more than conqueror. I thank thee, holy Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight. Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    why me? A sense of this distinguishing love will make you laugh at all that men or devils can say of or do unto you. Good night. I must away and pray for you. To-morrow <abbr

The issue of the trial you may leave to the Judge; he is always the injured prisoners friend. If confined to college, this will be a good exercise for you. You may lodge it in court, as a proof whether you understand to write plain <i>English</i>, or sound, practical, experimental divinity. This can do you no harm; it may do good. Do therefore set about it. I know one who will readily revile and correct, if necessary. The <span

It was the constancy of the three children, (the three heroes) that confounded their enemies. The company of the Son of man is never so sweet, as when he walks with us in the fiery furnace, never so glorious, as when he is seen keeping his honest <i>Daniels</i> company in a den of lions. You have therefore your answers ready, “We are not careful about this matter; we will not bow down to the golden image which <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> hath set up; the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    whom we serve is able to deliver us.” If you do not like these examples, take <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i>. Suppose dear ―― to be <i>John</i>, and ―― to be <i>Peter</i>. You know how the high-priests addressed them, you know their answer. By their answer, by their boldness, they took notice that they had been with <span

    Nothing, nothing can stand before an honest truly <i>Israelitish</i> heart. But this is enough for a sick-bed lecture. I would only add, that those who endeavour to entangle <span

She hath been sick, nigh unto death, but through mercy is now somewhat recovered, though as yet unable to write much. This her

    last week. His corpse lies deposited in her Ladyship’s chapel, and is not to be removed till next <i>Friday</i> morning. There have been public prayers and preaching twice every day. The noble relatives constantly attend, and all is more than solemn. Great numbers of all ranks croud to see and hear; I trust many will also feel. The deceased Earl died like the patriarch <i>Jacob</i>; he laid his hands on, and blessed his children, assured them of his personal interest in <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>LL hath been awful, and more than awful. On <i>Saturday</i> evening, before the corpse was taken from <i>B――n-House</i>, a word of exhortation was given, and a hymn sung in the room where the corpse lay. The young Earl stood with his hands on the head of the coffin, the Countess Dowager on his right hand, Lady <i>Ann</i> and Lady <i>Isabella</i> on his left, and their brother <i>Thomas</i> next to their mother, with Miss <i>O――n</i>, Miss <i>Wh――r</i>, Miss <i>G――e</i>; on one side all domestics, with a few friends on the other. The word of exhortation was received with great solemnity, and most wept under the parting prayer. At ten the corpse was removed to good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s chapel, where it was deposited within a place railed in for that
    <a id="p364"></a>purpose, covered with black bays, and the usual funeral concomitants, except escutcheons. On <i>Sunday</i> morning, all attended in mourning at early sacrament. They were seated by themselves, at the feet of the corpse, and with their head servants, received first, and a particular address was made to them. Immediately after receiving, these verses were sung for them:</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered txt_i">
      <p>Our lives, our blood, we here present,</p>
      <p>If for thy truths they may be spent:</p>

      <p>’Tis fix’d, they can do all through Thee.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00">
    Then they received this blessing, “The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> bless you and keep you, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    lift up the light of his countenance upon you, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    cause his face to shine upon you, and give you peace,” and so returned to their places. Sacrament ended (and a blessed sacrament it was) the Noble Mourners returned to good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s house, which was lent them for the day. At eleven, public service begun. The bereaved relations sat in order within, and the domestics around the outside of the rail. The chapel was more than crouded. Near three hundred tickets signed by the present Earl, were given out to the nobility and gentry, to be admitted. All was hush’d and solemn. Proper hymns were sung, and I preached on these words, “I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write, blessed are the dead that die in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.”
    Attention sat on every face, and deep and almost universal impressions were made. The like scene, and if possible more solemn, was exhibited in the evening, and I was enabled to preach a second time, and a like power attended the word as in the morning. Ever since, there hath been public service and preaching twice a day. This is to be continued till <i>Friday</i> morning, then all is to be removed to <i>Bristol</i>, in order to be shipped off for <i>Scotland</i>. The inscription on the coffin runs thus;</p>
  <p class="blk_90 vm_stanza" id="p365">
    “His life was honourable,—his death blessed,—he sought earnestly peace with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,—he
    found it with unspeakable joy alone in the merits of <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    witnessed by the holy Spirit to his soul,—he yet speaketh.—Go thou and do likewise.”</p>
  <p class="vm_stanza in_00">
    I have oftened wished for your Ladyship here. Congregations are very large, attentive, and deeply impressed. Surely the death of this noble Earl, thus improved, will prove the life of many. He had great foretastes of heaven, cried, “Come Holy Ghost;” he came, and filled him with joy unspeakable. Happy, happy, were his last dying words. All surviving relatives still feel the influence. They sit round the corpse attended by their domestics and supporters twice a day. Good Lady <i>S――x</i> gets fresh spirits. She loves your Ladyship dearly. I am called to attend, and therefore must hasten to acknowledge innumerable obligations, and to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,</p>

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HY do you and I exchange letters so seldom? Perhaps it would be better to correspond more frequently. This brings you the good news of the triumphant death of the late Earl of <i>B――n</i>. He behaved like the patriarch <i>Jacob</i>, when by faith leaning upon his staff, he blessed his children. The Earl added, “Yea, and they shall be blessed.” “Had I
    <a id="p367"></a>strength of body, (cried the Earl) I would not be ashamed before men and angels to tell what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    hath done for my soul. Come, holy Ghost, come, holy Ghost; happy, happy, happy!” and then sweetly slept in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    The present noble Earl, I believe, hath got the blessing indeed, and seems, upon the best evidence, to determine to know nothing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and him crucified. He hath behaved in the most delicate manner to the Countess, and other noble survivors. He stands here in town, against all opposition, like an impregnable rock; and I humbly hope will prove the <i>Daniel</i> of the age. He must be, nay he hath been already thrown into a den of lions; but he hath one with him, that stops the lions mouths. You will encourage all <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people to pray for him. What if you wrote him a line? I am sure it will be taken kindly; for I know he honours and loves you much. You will communicate this to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>M――ch</i>, who, I suppose, like me, is groaning, being burdened. I am now fifty-three years old. Did you ever hear of such a fifty-three years old barren fig-tree? So much digging, so much dunging, and yet so little fruit. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be merciful to me a sinner! A sinner—a sinner—a sinner. He is merciful; he is gracious: his mercy endureth for ever. He yet vouchsafes to bless my feeble labours. You would have been delighted to have seen the awful scene exhibited at <i>Bath</i>, whilst the late noble Earl lay in state. Two sermons every day; life and power attended the word; and I verily believe many dead souls were made to hear the voice of the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Since that we have been favoured with comfortable seasons in town. I hope you are blessed in <i>Glasgow</i>. Who knows but we may have one more interview in Spring? Whether we meet next on earth or in heaven, you will find that with great sincerity I subscribe myself, reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    I wish you had advertised against the publisher of my last sermon. It is not <i>verbatim</i> as I delivered it. In some places, he makes me to speak false concord, and even nonsense.

Your last was dated, <i>November 2</i>: several months have intervened. I now almost despair of hearing from you again, till my arrival at <i>Boston</i>. But I hope that you and all remember us more frequently than you write. You are daily remembered at a throne of grace. How glad would many be to see our <i>Goshen</i>, our <i>Bethel</i>, our <i>Bethesda</i>! Never did I enjoy such domestic peace, comfort, and joy during my whole pilgrimage. It is unspeakable, it is full of glory. Peace, peace unutterable attends our paths, and a pleasing prospect of increasing, useful prosperity is continually rising to our view. I have lately taken six poor children, and, <span

But what scheme to pursue, I know not, being so uncertain as to the path which I shall be called to take. A few months will determine: perhaps a few weeks.

O for a spirit of love and moderation on all sides, and on both sides the water! I wish some books might be procured for our infant library. But more of this in my next. Letters may now be sent by way of <i>Boston</i>, <i>New York</i>, and <i>Philadelphia</i>. I should be glad to hear often, if it be but a line. In all probability I shall not return hither till <i>November</i>. Was ever any man blest with such a sett of skilful, peaceful, laborious helpers! O <i>Bethesda</i>, my <i>Bethel</i>, my <i>Peniel</i>! My happiness is inconceivable. A few hundreds, besides what is already devoted, would finish all. I do not in the least doubt. I have had nine or ten prizes lately. You know what I mean. Nine or ten orphans have been lately taken in. <i>Hallelujah! hallelujah!</i> Let Chapel, Tabernacle, heaven, and earth, rebound with <i>Hallelujah</i>! I can no more.

    <i>My very dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> HAVE been here just a week. Have been enabled to preach four times, and am to repeat the delightful task this evening. Congregations are rather larger than ever. You will see by the inclosed packet, what numerous invitations from every quarter I am daily receiving. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have been strengthened to itinerate and preach daily for some time. Next week I purpose to go to <i>Albany</i>. From thence, perhaps, to the <i>Onoida Indians</i>. There is to be a very large <i>Indian</i> congress; <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Kirkland</i> accompanies me. He is a truly christian minister, and missionary. Every thing possible should be done to strengthen his hands and his heart. I shall write, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, at my return. The letters dated <i>February 22</i>, with the packet of papers, I have received here from <i>Charles-Town</i>. The <i>New-York</i> packet is the surest conveyance. Perhaps I may not see <i>Georgia</i> till <i>Christmas</i>. As yet, I keep to my intended plan, in respect to my returning. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    direct my goings in thy way! The heat begins now to be a little intense; but through mercy I am enabled to bear up bravely. What a <span
      class="smcap">God</span> do we serve! By this time I hope <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE my last, and during this month, I have been above a five hundred miles circuit, and have been enabled to preach and travel through the heat every day. The congregations
    <a id="p425"></a>have been very large, attentive, and affected, particularly at <i>Albany</i>, <i>Schenecdady</i>, <i>Great Barrington</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Sharon</i>, <i>Smithfield</i>, <i>Powkeepsy</i>, <i>Fishkill</i>, <i>New Rumburt</i>, <i>New Windsor</i>, and <i>Peckshill</i>. Last night I returned hither, and hope to set out for <i>Boston</i> in two or three days. O what a new scene of usefulness is opening in various parts of this new world! All fresh work, where I have been. The divine influence hath been as at the first. Invitations croud upon me both from ministers and people, from many, many quarters. A very peculiar providence led me lately to a place, where a horse-stealer was executed. Thousands attended. The poor criminal had sent me several letters, hearing I was in the country. The Sheriff allowed him to come and hear a sermon under an adjacent tree. Solemn, solemn! After being by himself about an hour, I walked half a mile with him to the gallows. His heart had been softened before my first visit. He seemed full of solid divine consolations. An instructive walk. I went up with him into the cart. He gave a short
    exhortation. I then stood upon the coffin, added, I trust, a word in season, prayed, gave the blessing, and took my leave. Effectual good, I hope, was done to the hearers and spectators. Grace! grace! But I must not enlarge. The Ship is going, and I keep at home to write this. O that you had only dropped a line by the <i>New-York</i> packet! That is convenient for all parts of the continent. My next may be from <i>Boston</i>. Pray excuse me to all; for travelling and preaching entirely prevent my writing as I would. All are continually remembered by, my very dear friend,</p>

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>D――n</i> was arrived, <i>Anderson</i> sailed, and that all orders would be immediately complied with. Two or three evenings ago, I was taken in the night with a violent lax, attended with reaching and shivering, so that I was obliged to return from <i>Newbury</i>, <abbr

      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>;
    but, through infinite mercy, I am restored, and to-morrow morning hope to begin to begin again. Never was the word received with greater eagerness than now. All opposition seems as it were for a while to cease. I find <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    time is the best. The season is critical as to outward circumstances. But when forts are given up, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    can appoint salvation for walls and for bulwarks; he hath promised to be a wall of fire round about his people. This comforts me concerning <i>Bethesda</i>, though we should have a <i>Spanish</i> war. You will be pleased to hear I never was carried through the summer’s heat so well; I hope it hath been so with you, and all my family.

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letters, of <i>May 2</i> and <i>22</i>, came to hand. <i>New-York</i> packet is always the surest and most centrical medium of conveyance. Before I left <i>Boston</i>, on <i>Friday</i> afternoon, I left a large packet in the hands of a young man, who promised to deliver it to you safely. You and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>H――y</i> may peruse all, and communicate what you think proper. By this time I thought to be moving southward. But never was greater importunity used to detain me longer in these northern parts. Poor <i>New-England</i> is much to be pitied; <i>Boston</i> people most of all. How falsely misrepresented!

    You will see, by the many invitations, what a door is opened for preaching his everlasting gospel. I was so ill on <i>Friday</i>, that I could not preach, though thousands were waiting to hear. Well, the day of release will shortly come,<a

    but it does not seem yet; for, by riding sixty miles, I am better, and hope to preach here to-morrow. I trust, my blessed Master will accept of these poor efforts to serve him. O for a warm heart; O to stand fast in the faith, to quit ourselves like men, and be strong! May this be the happy experience of you and yours! I suppose letters are gone for me, in <i>Anderson</i>, to <i>Georgia</i>. If spared so long, I expect to see it about <i>Christmas</i>. Still pray and praise. I am so poorly, and so engaged when able to preach, that this must apologize for not writing to more friends. It is quite impracticable. Hoping to see all dear friends about the time proposed, and earnestly desiring a continued interest in all your prayers, I must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear, very dear Sir,</p>

    <i>My good Friends</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>S <span class="smcap">God</span> has been pleased to place you more especially under my care; so whether absent or present, I think it my duty to contribute my utmost endeavours towards promoting the salvation of your precious and immortal souls. For this end, and this only, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is my judge, came I amongst you; for this end am I now parted from you for a season; and for this end do I send you this general epistle. I love, I pray for, therefore do I write to you all without exception. But what shall I write to you about? Why, of our common salvation, of that one thing needful, of that new birth in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    that ineffable change which must pass upon our hearts, before we can see <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and of which you have heard me discourse so often. Let this, this, my dear friends, be the end of all your actions. Have this continually in view, and you will never do amiss. The author of this blessed change, is the Holy Ghost, the third person in the ever-blessed Trinity. The Father made, the Son redeemed, and the Holy Spirit is to sanctify, and so apply <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s redemption to our
    <a id="p429"></a>hearts. The means to attain this Holy Spirit, you know, and the way you know; <i>Self-denial</i>, and the <i>way of the Cross</i>. “If any man will come after me (says <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>)
    let him deny himself, and, take up his cross daily, and follow me.” And, I cannot but think it a particular blessing, which you enjoy above others; because you are in a new colony, where daily crosses must necessarily fall in your way. O then, I beseech you by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    make a virtue of necessity, and take up your daily crosses with resignation and thanksgiving. Another means to attain the Holy Spirit, is <i>public worship</i>: for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    has promised, “where two or three are gathered together in his name, there will he, by his Spirit, be in the midst of them.” For your zeal in this particular, I have often blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    within myself, and made mention of it to others. O continue like-minded, and as in my presence, so in my absence, do not forsake the assembling yourselves together in the house of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    for there you will have the scriptures read, though not expounded; and the Holy Spirit, if you apply to him, will open your understandings, and guide you into all truth. Many other means there are of attaining the Holy Ghost, such as, <i>reading the scriptures,—secret prayer,—self-examination</i>, and <i>receiving the blessed Sacrament</i>;—all which I would insist on, could they be comprised in a letter. But this must be deferred till I see you in person, and am qualified to administer unto you the sacred symbols of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    blessed body and blood. In the mean while, think not that I shall forget you in my prayers; no, I remember my promise, and whilst the winds and storms are blowing over me, I make supplication to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in your behalf. Though absent in body, I am present in spirit, and joy in hopes of hearing of your zeal for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Remember, my dear friends, that for the space of near four months, I ceased not, day and night, warning every one of you to repent and turn to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Repent you therefore, and walk in all things as becometh the gospel of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    and then, and then only, shall your sins be blotted out. Finally, my brethren, be all of one mind. Let there be no divisions among you; for a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand. Be over careful for nothing, but
    <a id="p430"></a>in every thing, with supplications and thanksgiving make your wants known unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Speak not evil one of another, brethren, but live at peace among yourselves; and the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of peace shall in all things direct and rule your hearts. Brethren, pray for us, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    would prosper the works of his hands upon me, and restore me to you as soon as possible. In about eight months, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope to see you; in the mean while, you shall not be forgotten by</p>

    Be stedfast therefore, my brethren, be unmoveable. Carefully attend to the words spoken by your present Pastor, and strive to enter in at the strait gate. Let love be without dissimulation.

  <p class="chaphdbrk in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>EING now about to embark for <i>Georgia</i>, I am willing, before I go, to give the world a short account of the Orphan-House erected there. I have, therefore, in the following sheets, reprinted a continuation of an account published when I was last at <i>Edinburgh</i>; to which I have subjoined some letters received since; and also an account of money received and disbursed since the publication of that account: and in order to give the reader a view of this design from its beginning, I have affixed my preface to the account I first published about two years ago. I commend it to <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE following sheets, to the best of my knowledge, contain a faithful account of what money I have received, as also how I have disbursed it, for the use of the Orphan-House in <i>Georgia</i>.</p>
  <p>
    I think, with a full assurance of faith I may affirm, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    put it into my heart to build that house. It has prospered beyond expectation. It has already, and I hope will more and more answer its name, <i>Bethesda</i>, and be a House of Mercy to the souls and bodies of many people, both old and young.</p>
  <p id="p432">
    When I left <i>England</i>, I proposed to take in only twenty children; but when I arrived at <i>Georgia</i>, I found so many objects of charity, besides the orphans, among poor people’s children, that I resolved in this, as well as in all other respects, to imitate Professor <i>Franck</i>, and make a provision for <i>their</i> maintenance also.</p>
  <p>
    Two of the orphan boys were put out apprentices just before I last left <i>Savannah</i>; one to a bricklayer, the other was bound to a carpenter; a third is to be bound to the surgeon belonging to the Orphan-House; one weaves in a loom at home; two I have put to a taylor I brought over, and the rest are now fitting themselves to be useful to the commonwealth. Whoever among them appear to be sanctified, and have a good natural capacity, these, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I intend for the ministry.</p>
  <p>
    None of the girls are put out as yet, but are taught such things as may make them serviceable whenever they go abroad. Two or three of them spin very well. Some of them knit, wash, clean the house, get up the linen, and are taught house-wifery. All that are capable, are taught to sew. And the little girls, as well as the boys, are employed in picking cotton. I think I have no less than three hundred and eighty-two yards of cloth already in the house, and as much yarn spun as will make near the same quantity; a thing not known before in <i>Georgia</i>.</p>
  <p>
    I have now forty-nine children under my care, twenty-three <i>English</i>, ten <i>Scots</i>, four <i>Dutch</i>, five <i>French</i>, seven <i>Americans</i>. Twenty-two of these are fatherless and motherless, sixteen of them boys, and six girls. The others are some fatherless, and some without mothers; all objects of charity except three, whose friends recompense the Orphan-House for their maintenance. One of the orphans is an infant; I pay four shillings <i>per</i> week for nursing it. Since <i>December</i> last, we have had above eighteen more children that have been maintained occasionally, to assist their parents, but were dismissed when they were wanted at home.</p>
  <p>
    The account which I find <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Seward</i> has given of our œconomy, has in a great measure prevented my doing it as I intended. Let it suffice to inform our benefactors, that though the children are taught to labour for the meat which perisheth, yet they are continually reminded to seek <i>first</i> the kingdom of
    <a id="p433"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> and his righteousness, and then to depend upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    blessing on their honest endeavours, for having food and raiment added unto them. This precept of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I intend, when the house is finished, to have written over against the entrance in at the great door.</p>
  <p>
    As my design in founding the Orphan-House was to build up souls for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I endeavour to preach chiefly to the children’s hearts. But that they may be able to give a reason of the hope that is in them, I constantly instruct them by the Church of <i>England</i>’s Articles, which I turn into catechetical questions. I am often pleased to hear how judiciously some will answer the questions put to them. The power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been frequently visible among the children. Many of the girls seem to be tender-hearted; several of the boys have been under strong convictions. And though it sometimes seems buried, yet I cannot but think the seed of grace is sown in some of their hearts.</p>
  <p>
    We are now all removed to <i>Bethesda</i>. We live in the out-houses at present; but in less than two months, the great house will be finished so as to receive the whole family.</p>
  <p>
    It is now weather-boarded and shingled, and a piazza of ten feet wide built all around it: which will be wonderfully convenient in the heat of summer. One part of the house would have been entirely finished, had not the <i>Spaniards</i> lately taken from us a schooner loaded with ten thousands bricks, and a great deal of provision, with one of our family. And therefore, I could not till very lately procure another boat to fetch brick from <i>Charles-Town</i>.</p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding this, and many other hindrances, the work has been carried on with great success and speed. There are no less than four framed houses, a large stable and cart-house, beside the great house. In that there will be sixteen commodious rooms, besides a large cellar of sixty feet long and forty wide. Near twenty acres of land are cleared round about it, and a large road is made from <i>Savannah</i> to the Orphan-house, twelve miles in length: a thing, ever since the province has been settled, without a precedent.</p>
  <p>
    None but those upon the spot can tell the expence, as well as inconvenience that attends building in <i>Georgia</i>. Most of the bricks already used, cost 40<span
      class="txt_i"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
    sterling <i>per</i> thousand, when
    <a id="p434"></a>landed at the plantation. Common labourers, besides their provisions, have 25<span
      class="txt_i"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
    sterling a month. And, after all, <a
      id="p434a" href="#n_33">♦</a>the
    produce of the land cultivated by white servants, will scarcely furnish them with ordinary food and raiment, exclusive of the expences of sickness and wages. I cannot see how it is possible for the Colony to subsist on its present footing. And in a late memorial given in to the Honourable Trustees, unknown to me, the people have declared, that if it were not for the money that has been expended on account of the Orphan-house, the poor inhabitants of the northern parts of the colony must have been obliged to move to some other place. Never did a country stand more in need of a charity-school.</p>

    We have often been in some difficulties, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    as often hath relieved us out of them. When the schooner was lost, a person lately converted, sent us eleven barrels of rice, and five barrels of beef. And in my absence, when my family had little or no provisions, the <i>Indians</i> brought in plenty of deer, till they were supplied with food some other way. The contributions in <i>Charles-Town</i>, <i>New-England</i>, <i>New-York</i>, and <i>Pensilvania</i>, I think have been extraordinary.</p>
  <p>
    The infirmary, which has likewise been supported by this institution, has been of great service. The surgeon informs me, that if every one had been forced to pay for their nursing and medicines, it would have cost them two hundred pounds, sterling. I have now three or four sick: I keep a woman to attend them constantly.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="smcap">God</span> has much blessed our family with health. Only two have died out of so large a number, since my arrival; and these were two that came with me from <i>England</i>: a taylor, and one of the women: I believe they are now with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
  <p>
    I have left behind me, as my assistants, (who have no other gratuity than food and raiment) two school-masters and their wives who are school-mistresses. One young man, who is also married to a young maiden, lately brought home to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have left at the Orphan-house, as superintendent, and chief manager of the outward things. There are also the surgeon and his wife, a shoemaker and spinstress; besides labourers and monthly hired servants: I think, in all, I have upwards of eighty. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I am persuaded, is able and willing to provide for them.</p>
  <p id="p435">
    I think we have near two hundred hogs, and one hundred head of cattle. I give a man forty pounds sterling, <i>per annum</i>, to take care of them; he providing himself with provision, horses, and a servant. As yet we have had no advantage from our stock, it being a very dry season last summer; so that our cattle of all kinds have scarcely food to eat. But in a year or two, we hope, by the divine blessing, to have a considerable quantity of fresh provisions for our family.</p>
  <p>
    As for manuring more land than the hired servants and great boys can manage, it is impracticable without a few negroes. It will in no wise answer the expence.</p>
  <p>
    I am now upwards of eight hundred pounds in debt, on the Orphan-house account. Some particular friends have been pleased to assist me. I doubt not but our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will enable me to pay them, and also raise up fresh supplies for the maintenance of my large family.</p>
  <p>
    I much rejoice in the institution: it has been very beneficial, not only to the bodies, but also to the souls of the labourers. One woman received <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    very lately at <i>Bethesda</i>: and I have great reason to believe, that three or four strangers, who came to see us, have been effectually brought home to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
  <p>
    Great calumnies have been spread abroad concerning our management of the children: people shoot out their bitter arrows in <i>America</i>, as well as in <i>England</i>. One poor man was filled with such resentment, at the reports he had heard of our cruelty to the children, that he came on purpose from <i>South-Carolina</i>, to take away his two boys, whom out of compassion, I had taken into the Orphan-House: but, when he came and saw the manner in which they were educated, he was so far from taking his children away, that he desired to come and live at the Orphan-house himself.</p>
  <p>
    I speak not this by way of boasting, or to wipe off reproach; for I know, let me do what I will, I shall never please some men. I thought proper to give this short account, for the satisfaction of those who have already contributed, and of others who may be stirred up by our good <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to contribute hereafter towards carrying on this good design.</p>

    Besides these hymns, they generally sing a grace before and after meat, and are taught so to vary their exercises, that they may not be cloyed by a too frequent repetition of the same things on the one hand, and yet are kept in such a general method, that they may not learn to be desultory and fickle on the other.</p>

    Continuation of the Account of the Orphan-House in Georgia.</span></h3>
  <p class="align_date">
    <i>Edinburgh, September 14, 1742.</i></p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has been pleased to put me into the ministry, it has been my constant prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that I might <i>provide things honest in the sight of all men</i>. Not one part of my outward conduct, as I know of, hath passed unobserved and uncensured by some wicked unreasonable men: but what seems to have given the greatest offence, and caused the loudest outcry, has been my making public collections for an Orphan-House in <i>Georgia</i>.</p>
  <p>
    Some indeed affirm that there is no such thing. But how it could enter into the heart of any to say so, I should not have conceived, unless the scripture had said, <i>the heart of man is desperately wicked</i>.</p>
  <p>
    Somewhat more than a twelve-month ago, I printed an account of the situation and oeconomy of the Orphan-House, and what I was in arrears when I left <i>Georgia</i>, <i>January 1741</i>. My chief design now, is, to give a short account of the progress of the work since, both as to our temporal and spiritual concerns, so far as lies in my power.</p>
  <p>
    The salvation of souls is the chief thing I had in view, when <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    put it into my heart to build this house. I would then begin with that first.</p>
  <p>
    And here I would pause a while, and acknowledge that I am much indebted to the divine goodness, for what he has already done for many souls, since its first institution. I must confess, to the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it has far exceeded my expectations.</p>
  <p>
    During the time I was among them, before my going to, and after my return from, <i>Philadelphia</i>, <i>Boston</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    there were several remarkable awakenings amongst the children, and others, belonging to the house, much resembling the blessed awakening now at <i>Cambuslang</i>, and other places in these kingdoms;
    <a id="p440"></a>as will appear from consulting some of my latest Journals. Just before I came last away, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was much amongst us; at which time, a young man, about twenty-one years of age, was converted, who since has been made a blessed instrument of converting many poor negroes in <i>South-Carolina</i>. Several others also, that came to pay us a visit at the Orphan-House, were really brought home to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and now bring forth the fruits of the spirit in their lives and conversations. How it has been with my family since my departure, will best appear by publishing some extracts from the letters which have been sent me from time to time, since my departure.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    <i><abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> Habersham</i>, superintendent of the outward affairs in the Orphan-House, and who, I am persuaded, loves the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> in sincerity, writes me thus:</p>
  <p class="align_date">
    <i>Bethesda, March 24, 1741.</i></p>
  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dearest Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap"><span
      class="pref_drop">――</span>T</span>HE spirit of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    seems to be moving upon the faces of many souls here; most, if not all the boys, seem to be under some concern; little as well as great boys, cry mightily to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    the son of <i>David</i>, to have mercy upon them. About fourteen days ago, at brother <i>Barber</i>’s request, I spoke to the children at evening prayer. My soul at that time was bowed down with a sense of my own, and especially of your poor lambs deadness to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    but our gracious Redeemer, who is always ready to help in time of need, was pleased to give me power to speak to their consciences. I think I could and did justly appeal to their hearts, that they wanted neither bodily or spiritual food: I told them, that they, as well as myself, could not be insensible what little care was taken of them before they came to us, and consequently how ungrateful they were not to improve such means as they now enjoyed: I beseeched them, by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that they would improve this their day of salvation, that we and our benefactors might rejoice; we in the work of our hands, they in the fruit of their bounty. An impression was made on some; I observed them the next day retire into the woods, to sing and pray together. Two nights afterwards, I spoke to them again, and as I promised, so I returned them my public thanks for
    <a id="p441"></a>their little amendment, with tears of love and joy: I felt the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    powerfully on my own soul, and it seemed to reach the children, and put them under a visible concern. Ever since, brother <i>Barber</i> has put the great boys into two companies, and they constantly meet together every day to sing and pray. <i>Saturday</i>, the <abbr
      title="twenty-first">21st</abbr>
    instant, the presence of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    came down among the children, little and great, as they were talking among themselves about eternity; and they cried so much to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    of <i>Nazareth</i>, to have mercy upon them, that the family soon heard them. We all went, saw, and wept over about twenty-five or thirty dear lambs, upon their knees before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    some pleading the promises, and others calling on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    O how did my hard heart rejoice! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    many of them seem to retain their convictions, and all are serious. Does not your soul leap for joy, and say, Bless the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O my friends, and let us magnify his name together! Indeed, my dear brother, all the glory is due to him. Whilst I am writing, I blush, that I should mention any thing about what I was only in a little measure an instrument. Methinks I could wish to disappear, that the creature might be abased, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be all in all. I have great hopes that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will bring some effectually to himself. The work seems to be more solid among them, and more the effect of consideration, than that of last summer. I rejoice much, that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    sent brother <i>Barber</i> among us; for I have neither leisure nor ability to speak much to the children, and he seems to delight to watch over their souls: I trust the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will make him a blessing to us all; I think it will be our own fault if he is not. One or two of the labourers, I hope, have closed with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    for salvation; and one or two more are in a fair way to do so.</p>

    <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Habersham</i>, in another Letter, writes thus from <i>Charles-Town</i>.</p>
  <p class="align_date">
    <i>June 11, 1741.</i></p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap"><span

    rages furiously against our Orphan-House in this province: such lies and calumnies are raised against us, that our few dear friends think it necessary for me to represent the present state of the house. I have since been much in prayer, and believe <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will direct me how to act. Some here, since you went away, have gone great lengths in
    <a id="p442"></a>asserting calumnies, even so as to offer to take oaths for the truth of them. Since I came, I went to them, to enquire what foundation they had for such reports; and it would surprise you to see their behaviour: they are ashamed to lift up their faces. Thus shall the wicked stand dumb at the bar of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think I can say, to the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that our family never was in a better condition. The children, the <i>essence of our constitution</i>, are well taken care of, and watched over. We all live in love. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been visibly among us, especially with the children. <i>Bethesda</i>, as to its outward circumstances, is so much for the better, that you would be surprised to see it. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    enables us to keep up much order. He likewise (blessed be his name) has given us the appearance of a plentiful crop. The garden and plantation now afford us many comfortable things, and in great plenty. Our stores are yet well stocked with flour and beef, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>W――</i> behaves with great integrity, and is faithful in his work. The house would be soon finished, if we could get bricks. <i>J. S.</i> is ready to do all our bricklayers work <i>gratis</i>. Brother <i>W――</i> is a great blessing to the family. If you come by way of <i>Philadelphia</i>, pray bring some hemp and coarse flax. He has weaved and spun a great deal for us. All the boys now lye in the great house. They have also coats, and lye in sheets of their own making: by this means they are kept sweet and clean. We have a fine growing stock of cattle; and if <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    should so order it, that we should have a plantation in <i>Carolina</i>, as I believe he will bring to pass, we shall need but little, if any, assistance from abroad. If our building were now done, our expences would be but trifling to what they have been.</p>

    was pleased effectually to call <i>Thomas W――b</i>; his conversion was very clear, and much to the satisfaction of some, especially to his good old father. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>K――y</i>, our taylor, and his wife, have been wrought upon, I hope savingly, since they have been here: I am not without hope that some of the children are likewise, and that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    in due time will convert more of them. I hope he is now shewing us that the work is wholly of him; that when the day of his power, the time, the appointed time of his love is come, we may be better prepared to give all the glory thereof to him. As to myself, I must confess that I am a poor worthless instrument, to be employed in the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>; but what shall we say, if the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to make use of the foolish to confound the wise? I have, blessed be <span

    had a little freedom given me lately to speak to your family; but I want to have my heart more and more enlarged towards them, and to speak to them more and more in the demonstration of the Spirit, and with power. Who knows? perhaps <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    designs you should have the honour and happiness of being the spiritual father of many more in your family. May the <span

    affairs, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    have prospered far beyond our expectation. We have seen, and do daily see, much of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    fatherly care, in providing for and protecting us; and though <i>we have no visible fund</i>, yet we doubt not, but he that has begun, will carry on and perfect his work against every opposition. We have been plentifully supplied all the summer, while many about us lacked. Our building and necessary conveniences, are now compleated. Our family now consists of eighty-four persons, men, women, and children, and nineteen more are employed about us, and five in the Infirmary: the latter have a doctor and nurse, and all other necessaries found them at the Orphan-house expence. We have fifty-eight children: thirty-two of them belong to the colony; six to <i>Purisburgh</i>, who are, I think, as great objects of charity as any in <i>Georgia</i>; and the rest belong to the neighbouring provinces, who are orphans and objects of charity, except a few who are maintained at their friends and parents charge. We have a taylor and shoemaker: likewise two weavers; each of them have got a loom, but we can employ but one, spinning here being extravagantly dear; though we hope in a short time to spin as much <i>within ourselves</i>, as will greatly assist in cloathing the family. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blesses our cattle; we have upwards of an hundred head, small and great, and shall be able in a year or two to kill a great quantity. Negroes not being allowed, and labour among us so expensive, we can make but little improvement in farming. This year we have planted upwards of twenty acres, and have cleared twenty acres more for to enjoy the conveniency of the air: and, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    though we have had a very dry season, yet we cannot complain, like many others, of a bad crop. Honoured Sir, you may now judge whether our design be drawing near a period. What I have written is a plain impartial narrative of our affairs, which our bitterest enemies
    <a id="p445"></a>will not pretend to gainsay. If any doubt it, I answer, as <i>Philip</i> did to <i>Nathaniel, Come and see</i>.</p>

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>B――</i>. No <i>New-York</i> vessels have come to this province of late. <i>We live entirely within ourselves</i>, except a few necessaries which we cannot do without, that we are obliged to purchase elsewhere. Twice a day we eat <i>hominy</i><a
      id="p445a" href="#n_35" class="anchor">¹</a>
    of our own raising, and at present without molasses. For dinner, we eat beef of our own stock, and pease for bread, of all which we have plenty, and shall have for three months to come. Our garden is very fruitful of greens, turneps, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and we expect a good crop of potatoes. In short, we have a sufficiency of wholesome food. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we daily see our heavenly Father’s hand supplying us in this wilderness-land. O that we were more thankful! I must have cash, not only to pay debts, but also to buy clothing and many other necessaries; and I believe our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will give it to me. He is our shepherd, therefore shall we lack nothing. I trust he has enabled us to pray in faith, nothing doubting but he will supply our every want. All here at present enjoy pretty good health. How thankful ought we to be! The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    seems to be sending his judgments abroad upon the earth. In <i>Carolina</i> and <i>Savannah</i> a murrain is among the cattle, which takes off great numbers: ours as yet have escaped. Thanks be to <span

    Indeed we are obliged to kill some of them for immediate supply. But what are all outward calamities, where <span

    A young Gentleman of <i>Boston</i>, having made a visit to the Orphan-House, sent the following account of it to his father, which many have desired may be printed, for the satisfaction of those who have already contributed to its support.</p>
  <p class="align_date">
    <i>Bethesda, January 1, 1742.</i></p>
  <p class="align_open">
    <i>Honoured Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>EING sensible of the many and false accounts industriously spread abroad concerning this house in many places, especially in <i>New-England</i>, by those who are enemies to its Founder, and the cause he is engaged in, which has certainly been a great hindrance to this worthy undertaking, as it has created even in its friends some prejudices, which has hindered their contributing with that pleasure and freedom they otherwise would have done; and as I am now upon the spot, I think a few moments will not be ill spent, in giving you a particular account of its present situation, which I shall endeavour to do in the most just and impartial manner, that you may have an opportunity of serving the interest in which your heart is so much engaged.</p>
  <p>
    The Orphan-House is pleasantly situated, and, with the buildings belonging to it, presents a much handsomer prospect than is given by the draught annexed to the public accounts. The great house is now almost quite finished, and nothing has hindered but the want of glass, which they daily expect from <i>Bristol</i>, and some bricks that are already at <i>Savannah</i>, and are to carry up another stack of chimnies, which would have been done before, if a vessel that was bringing brick and other stores, had not been taken by the <i>Spaniards</i>, which was a great loss. It is surprizing to see in what forwardness things are, considering what hindrances they have had, and the scarcity of labourers in this province. They have cut a fine road to <i>Savannah</i> of twelve miles length, through a thicket of woods; and, that it might be passable, were obliged to make ten bridges and cross-ways; which was done at no little charge. They have also cleared forty acres of land, twenty of which were planted the last year, and brought them a tolerable crop: the other twenty was for the benefit of the air. They have also a large garden at the front of the house, brought into pretty good order.</p>
  <p id="p447">
    The family now consists of eighty persons besides labourers, who all contradict the wicked and false accounts of their being starved and cruelly treated, by the lively and hearty countenances they shew. I have seldom seen such a goodly number of youths together. Twenty-three of them are orphans; others, that have lost one of their parents; one was born in the house; and the rest are fit objects for christian charity. There are in all thirty-nine boys, and <a
      id="p447a" href="#n_36">♦</a>fifteen
    girls. The number was larger some time past: but several of the boys, that were well instructed, have been put to such trades as they inclined to; and others, who were put here for their learning, are returned to their parents, who have handsomely paid the House for their education.</p>

    The care of this society at present is in the hands of a young gentleman from <i>London</i>, who manages the secular affairs thereof; and one from <i>New-England</i>, who has the care of souls as his particular charge. There are two school-masters, who instruct the boys in reading and writing: and those that appear serious, and of good capacities, are taught <i>Latin</i>, with a design of fitting them for the ministry, if they incline to it. Two school-mistresses, that teach the girls; a surgeon and nurse to attend the infirmary, in which many sick persons, from divers parts, have been received, and always been cured <i>gratis</i>. Here are also several tradesmen; a taylor, a joiner, a weaver, and a shoemaker. The taylor has three boys to instruct in his business. It is expected that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Whitefield</i> will increase the number of craftsmen, when he returns from <i>England</i>. The œconomy observed here is as follows: The bell rings in the morning at sun-rise, to wake the family. When the children arise, they sing a short hymn, and pray by themselves: then they go down and wash; and by the time they have done that, the bell calls to public worship, when a portion of scripture is read and expounded, a psalm sung, and the exercise begun and ended with prayer. Then they breakfast, and afterwards go some to their trades, and the rest to their prayers and schools. At noon, they all dine in the same room, and have comfortable and wholesome diet provided. A hymn is sung before and after dinner: then, in about half an hour, to school again; and between whiles find time enough for recreation. A little after sun-set the bell calls to public duty again,
    <a id="p448"></a>which is performed in the same manner as in the morning. After that they sup, and are attended to bed by one of their masters, who then pray with them, as they often do privately. On the sabbath-day they all dine on cold meat provided the day before, that none may be kept from public worship, which is attended four times a day in summer, and three in the winter. The children are kept to reading between whiles. Many have reported, that the place is very unhealthy: which I believe is quite otherwise, considering it is a new settlement: a remarkable proof of which is, that not one have died out of the family, (into which many sick and almost starved children have been received, who have in a short time recovered) and but three or four out of the hospital, where many miserable objects have been taken in. I believe many, who now think the erecting an Orphan-house in that colony a mad scheme, would alter their sentiments were they here. Innumerable difficulties have certainly been overcome; but their affairs now look with a pleasant aspect. If the colony is allowed negroes, as it is thought it must and will be, they can, with about
    twenty negroes to manure the plantation, which contains five hundred acres of land, raise much more provision than a larger family than this can expend, having already a fine live stock, which is daily increasing; so that in a few years, it is to be hoped, they will be able to support themselves. As to the state of religion here, particularly among the children, the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has, at times, been visible among them; and many of them have been brought under conviction, which seems lasting in some of the boys, and several of the girls: but most of the grown folks appear to be truly converted; and many, who have come as visitors, have been met with by the sovereign grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, and not sent empty away: may <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    grant I may make one of that number! Upon the whole, I think the institution to be of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>: therefore it doth and will prosper.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Since this came to my hand, I have received more letters from <i>Georgia</i>, dated in <i>May</i> and <i>June</i> last, which also give me an account of the continuation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s goodness to my dear family.</p>
  <p id="p449">
    The Reverend <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>Colman</i>, in a letter he sent to a minister near <i>Glasgow</i>, part of which I find printed in a pamphlet entituled, <i>The State of Religion in New-England</i>, writes thus:</p>
  <p>
    “<abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i> visited us in the right time, and found large contributions here: I doubt not but he will faithfully apply what he collected for his Orphan-house: but I have said to him, It will appear to me a greater wonder, if his faith is answered in that foundation, than that of Monsieur <i>Franck</i>’s, at <i>Hall</i>, in <i>Prussia</i>, was: the one being in the midst of <i>Europe</i>, the other on the confines of <i>America</i>. But the order and piety of the house is admirable, and so the progress of the settlement, alone as it is in the world, by the report of all that have visited it: but how it can subsist and flourish, and answer the Founder’s end, is the enquiry here, and will be a marvel in the providence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, if it do so.”</p>
  <p>
    The Reader may see, by this, the Doctor’s opinion of the Orphan-house, and the testimony given concerning it by persons who have visited it, and who therefore cannot be unacquainted with its situation. They profess, “The order of the house is admirable, and so the progress of the settlement, alone as it is in the world.” How it can subsist and flourish for the future, I am not solicitous about: <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    can help us in <i>Georgia</i>, as well as he helped Professor <i>Franck</i> in <i>Germany</i>. <i>The earth is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s,
    and the fulness thereof</i>. I acknowledge him to be the founder of that house: he put it into my heart to build it: it has in a great measure already answered the end of its institution, and I am persuaded will do so more and more. The greatest outward difficulties, I humbly hope, are now surmounted. The workmen are all discharged, having fulfilled their contract, and carried on the work so far as to make every part of the house habitable. Our stock of cattle is pretty considerable, and appear to be in a flourishing condition. And, when once I am clear from all arrears, the Orphan-house will be supported at a very easy expence. The last parliament resolved to support the colony of <i>Georgia</i>: they have altered the constitution in two material points; they have allowed the importation of rum, and free titles to the lands. And if they should see good hereafter to grant a limited use of negroes, it must certainly, in all outward appearance, be as
    <a id="p450"></a>flourishing a colony as <i>South-Carolina</i>. Not that we are without hopes, as <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i> writes me word in his last letter, of making a tolerable shift with white servants: the <i>Saltzburghers</i> do so already. There is a fresh body of them lately gone over, and some fresh troops to guard the frontiers of the colony. Not that I put any confidence in man, knowing that <i>the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong</i>, but Providence ruleth all things: but, at the same time, I would act with the greatest caution and circumspection, and not tempt <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by presuming on him without a cause. His having helped me and mine so often, encourages me to trust him again. He has put it into the hearts of some dear friends to give <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i> credit for cash during my absence; and his Excellency General <i>Oglethorpe</i> has been very friendly, having lent <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i> fifty pounds, and given the orphans nine barrels of flour: <i>the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    return him, and their other benefactors, ten thousand fold into their bosom</i>!</p>
  <p>
    But all this while, some will say, you give us no account of your collections in <i>Scotland</i> and elsewhere for near this year and an half. I will now do that to the best of my power, and likewise add an account of my disbursements; I say, <i>my disbursements</i>: for, having had no particular account of what <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i> has expended and borrowed since I have been from <i>Georgia</i>, I cannot possibly give an exact account of the whole; but I shall do it, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, immediately after my arrival at the Orphan-house, beginning where the former account left off. From that it appears, I was then upwards of eight hundred pounds upon arrears. Since that I have been absent near two years: and considering a family of eighty persons, or upwards, have been maintained, an infirmary kept up, the expence of further work done to the house, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    it will not appear unreasonable that I should be still upwards of six hundred pounds on arrears; as I judge I am, from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i>’s general intimations of cash he had borrowed in <i>America</i>, and what I have still to pay in <i>England</i>. But this will appear clear in the next account. In the mean while, the following accounts, I believe, will be satisfying to all the contributors<a
      id="p450a" href="#n_37" class="anchor">¹</a>:
    as for others, I do not think myself obliged
    <a id="p451"></a>to give them any account at all, any further than that I am commanded to <i>provide things honest in the sight of all men</i>. Neither do I believe, that this, or any account I can give, will satisfy captious men that are resolved to find fault: our Saviour himself could not please such. And if even good men can be so far prejudiced as to say, “The late glorious work at <i>Cambuslang</i>, is all delusion, and a work of the devil,” I do not wonder if some of his professed children speak all manner of evil of this undertaking: neither should I wonder after this, if they should affirm there was no such thing as an Orphan-house in being, though it was built but a few miles off them.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_37">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#p450a">¹</a> The accounts of particular receipts and disbursements are omitted, by reason of their vast length; and likewise, as the public have already examined them, and received full satisfaction.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    As for the aspersions that have been cast upon me, as though I collected money to enrich myself, it gives me little or no concern; the apostle <i>Paul</i> was branded as one that made a gain of people; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows the heart: at the day of judgment I will prove those persons liars. Professor <i>Franck</i> met with unspeakably more contempt and calumny, whilst he was building the Orphan-house in <i>Germany</i>: he began very low, and left behind him an Orphan-house which contains now, if I mistake not, two or three thousand students, notwithstanding the erecting it, was attended with as many improbabilities as this in <i>Georgia</i>: he has been dead about fourteen or sixteen years. His son now succeeds him in the care of the Orphan-house: I have had the pleasure of corresponding with him. An account of this Orphan-house was printed in his life-time, and it has been very strengthening and beneficial to my soul.</p>
  <p>
    If any, by reading this, shall be inclined to contribute any thing, either in money or goods, I trust <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will give me grace to apply it faithfully.</p>
  <p>
    I am not ashamed to beg for <span class="smcap">God</span> on this occasion; because my going to <i>Georgia</i>, and erecting the Orphan-house, was one great means in his hand, of bringing me out to preach the everlasting gospel in so many places, and to many thousands of poor perishing souls, who I doubt not (be it spoken with all humility) will evidence my commission thereto, by being my joy and crown of rejoicing in the last day. Blessed be his holy name, he has not left himself, nor me his servant, without witnesses of this sort in <i>Scotland</i>! Many, I trust, since this time twelvemonth, have been made to <i>taste that the
    <a id="p452"></a><span class="smcap">Lord</span> is gracious</i>, and have in an effectual manner <i>felt the powers of the world to come</i>: such in particular, I trust, will lift up holy hands in prayer for me, and for the prosperity of the Orphan-house, that the enemies of our holy religion may never have cause to triumph over its ruins, saying, <i>There, there, so would we have it</i>. I look upon the Orphan-house as a great part of my charge; a family given me by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to be supported and taken care of, for himself. Its very beginnings are not small; its latter end, I believe, will greatly increase. He that believeth, should not make haste to contemn the undertaking, or my conduct in carrying it on, seeing it has already evidently appeared to be of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    by the countenance and success he has given to both. And since the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    by his providence, has connected the care of this family with my preaching the gospel, by making it a means of first bringing me out, and ever since has been pleased to continue the care of it upon me; I think myself bound in duty, to recommend it in the strongest manner to all people amongst whom I am called to preach the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Neither do I think myself justly blameable for running so much in arrears on its account, since the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    in all places where he has been pleased to send me, has inclined the hearts of people to be ready to distribute, and willing to communicate on this occasion: and, I doubt not, will yet dispose the hearts of his people here and elsewhere, to be my farther assistants by their charitable contributions, seeing I am so necessarily engaged in the affair. <i>He that giveth to these</i> poor orphans, <i>lendeth to the</i> <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    and look, <i>Whatsoever he layeth out, it shall be repaid him again</i>.</p>
  <p>
    Those who, notwithstanding what has been said, still continue in suspense, I would entreat them at least to pray for me, that in this, and all my undertakings for the church of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    I may go on with an even, humble, resigned, chearful mind, and single eye to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    glory; and then, I doubt not but they will see a happy issue of this work, and future ages have reason to bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for ever putting it into my heart to build an Orphan-house in <i>Georgia</i>.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk align_date" id="p453">
    <i>September 22, 1742.</i></p>
  <p>
    Since the writing of this, I have heard of the <i>Spaniards</i> making a descent upon <i>Georgia</i>. I cannot say the news of it damped me at all; because, I humbly hope, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will not give that colony over as a prey into the enemy’s hand. The place where they landed, is about one hundred miles to the southward of the Orphan-house: and, supposing it should be taken, I do not repent the erecting it, because the <a
      id="p453a" href="#n_38">♦</a>advantages
    that have flowed already from it, as appears from my accounts, have abundantly answered the pains and expence it has cost. What is due upon arrears, as it has been already laid out, and is a debt contracted for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I doubt not but he will incline the hearts of his servants to help me by their contributions to discharge it. At the same time, I am not without expectations, that this very attack of the <i>Spaniards</i> will be over-ruled for the good of the Orphan-house, and be made a means of freeing the colony from their future insults: for as <i>Georgia</i> is a frontier colony, and stands as a barrier to all the other <i>English</i> provinces, it is reasonable to believe, they will all unite in its defence and protection. But my trust is in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    and, through the mercies of the Most High, I humbly hope this undertaking will not sink, but become more and more beneficial to <i>Georgia</i> and the neighbouring provinces day by day. <i>Let all that love the</i> <span

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Habersham</i>, superintendant of the Orphan-house affairs, in which he writes as follows:</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk align_date">

  <p class="align_open">
    <i>My dearest Brother and Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>BOUT four days ago I wrote you very fully in relation to our present state and circumstances, from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>John Bryan</i>’s. I hope our dear family are well there. When my last comes to hand, you will find we removed there for fear of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who came in upon <i>Georgia</i> like a flood. I hope the General will yet stand his ground, though the enemy is so numerous. I hear he destroyed and took one hundred and seventy of the enemy last <i>Thursday</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span> only knows what
    <a id="p454"></a>he is about to do with us. Brother <i>Grant</i> and I are here, to take care of our house and goods. I hope <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will direct us in our distress. Surely you will now, if possible, come over. I believe the bearer is gone; I must have done. Farewel, Farewel. Brother <i>Grant</i> gives his love. I must conclude by broken lines.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    P. S. Absolute hurry and necessity obliges me to write thus.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    This letter gave me much comfort, as it brought me the welcome news that my dear family was safe. This <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Bryan</i> was converted at the Orphan-house, and is a wealthy planter in <i>South-Carolina</i>. I admire the providence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in raising him up to take care of the little lambs in this time of their distress. I hope ere now they are returned to their <i>Bethesda</i> in peace.</p>
  <p>
    Blessed be <span class="smcap">God</span> I have not been disappointed of my hope. For since my return to <i>London</i>, I have received the following letters, which give a more particular account both of their tryal and deliverance, and for which I desire to praise our great and gracious <span

  <p class="secthdbrk align_ctr">
    From <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Habersham</i>, at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Jonathan Bryan</i>’s Plantation in <i>South-Carolina, July 11, 1742</i>.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <i>My dearest Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">G</span>OD’s ways are in the deep; the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    only knows what he is about to do with your dear family. Here at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Bull</i>’s and at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Hugh Bryan</i>’s they sojourn at present, and all, blessed be our gracious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    in pretty good bodily health. Distress from the hands of the <i>Spaniards</i> (under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>)
    seems to be coming upon poor <i>Georgia</i>, and perhaps upon this colony also. Our afflictions have been heavy: the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    only enabled us to bear up under them; but I really believe we have tasted but the first fruits of our trials. Was it not for a persuasion that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    can, yea, will help us, we must sink under a prospect of impending difficulties. About the <abbr
      title="twenty-fifth">25th</abbr>
    of last month several <i>Spanish</i> galleys came into <i>Cumberland</i> sound, a little to the South of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s, where the General’s forces
    <a id="p455"></a>are encamped. The General himself in a deal cutter, accompanied with two boats, was attacked by them, and had a very wonderful escape. The gallies went off as though they would go to <i>Augustine</i>; but a day or two after returned, attended with several schooners, sloops, and ships of force to <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s. Several days they lay within sight of the General’s camp. When we heard this, we kept a day of fasting, prayer, and humiliation, to ask direction of our great shepherd what we should do. As the <i>Spanish</i> fleet had then made no inroad upon the General, we concluded to <i>stand still</i> and wait upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. The <abbr
      title="fifth">5th</abbr>
    instant the <i>Spanish</i> fleet run into <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s <i>Sound</i>, up the river that leads to <i>Frederica</i>. The fleet, I hear, consisted of thirty-five or thirty-seven vessels; and notwithstanding the General fired upon them from his battery, and two privateers, and other vessels did the same, they passed without seeming to regard them, and landed a great number of people at <i>Gascoign’s Bluff</i> on <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s. The General seeing himself encompassed about with enemies, ordered several sloops, <i>New-Yorkers</i>, laden with provision to be sunk; his privateer sloop was burnt, and Captain <i>Thomson</i> and the <a
      id="p455a" href="#n_39">♦</a>schooner
    made the best of their way to the North. The General is now surrounded by the <i>Spaniards</i> upon an island, without having one vessel of any bigness to carry him and his army off. He retreated from <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s (burnt all the hutts, houses, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    there) to <i>Frederica</i>, and gave leave for the women and children, and I think all except his fighting people, to make their escape.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="tnote" id="n_39">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#p455a">♦</a>
        “scooner” replaced with “schooner”</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    The <abbr title="seventeenth">17th</abbr> instant several boats full of people passed by our house, and informed us of the above, and that it was thought the General’s army would be entirely cut off, unless great assistance was immediately sent them, which it is likely could not be done soon enough. We all met together, and prayed to our dear Father, and afterward desired every one to speak their mind freely, what was necessary to be done in this emergency. We considered it would be impossible to move so many children, weak women, and babes in their arms away upon a sudden approach of the enemy; that we were so locked in, that we could not get through the <i>Narrows</i> with our boats but four hours in twenty-four, and unanimously agreed to move them away directly. But we had one great objection
    <a id="p456"></a>to get over, the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>; we thought the providence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    plainly pointed out our removal; and if the <i>Spaniards</i> should be permitted to take and burn all before them, we should be accessary to the death of eighty-five poor creatures, and likewise bring a reproach upon religion, through our disregard of using means for our preservation. Our friends thought things might not be <i>so bad</i> as reported, and concluded to stay that evening at the Orphan-house, while I should go to <i>Savannah</i> to ask the advice of friends, and likewise be better informed about it. Accordingly I went about nine that evening, and returned at three in the morning. The news I had confirmed from the persons who had fled from <i>Frederica</i>; and our friends at <i>Savannah</i> advised us to move. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Jones</i> offered to lend me any assistance to do it. The next morning, as delays might be dangerous, we took as many goods out of the house as the boats would conveniently carry with the people. We had none about us but <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>K――</i>’s and <i>G――</i>’s family, and two sick men in the infirmary, and in all made about eighty-five or eighty-six persons. Then we had another difficulty to grapple with: we knew not where to go. If we went to <i>Ebenezer</i>, we had no opportunity of providing so large a body of people with provisions, and might be in as much danger there as at <i>Bethesda</i>. If we went to <i>Carolina</i>, we considered that it was there, in all probability, the enemy wanted to be, and were destroying <i>Georgia</i> in order to get there with the more safety. But believing we should be better able to make our retreat to the Northward from <i>Carolina</i>, if necessity should oblige us, and also should be better able to supply the family with victuals, we came here last night about twelve o’clock, and were received kindly by our dear friends, who think we have done right in moving.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
     <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Barber</i> who superintends the spiritual affairs of the family, in a letter dated near the same time writes,—“That as they were on their passage, they heard guns firing all round them, which occasioned them to think they were in the midst of their enemies.—This brought them into straits, not knowing which way to take to avoid falling into their hands.—But the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    giving them to strengthen themselves in him, they ventured on, and got safe to the shore; where they were informed, that the guns they had heard, where in <i>Carolina</i>, firing to alarm the
    <a id="p457"></a>province of the danger they apprehended they were in from the <i>Spaniards</i>. What those guns were that they heard firing from other quarters they did not know; most probably their enemies, whom the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    directed them to shun by taking the way they did.”</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Habersham</i>, again says,—How it is with <i>Georgia</i>, I have not heard these three days; but as we left a great quantity of goods at the Orphan-house, and fearing that it might be plundered, brother <i>Grant</i> and I, with four hands, are in a few minutes to go there. I think, as we have moved away the helpless people, if the enemy should come, we can the better make our escape. O my brother, I hope you will not blame us.—A sense of so many souls being liable to be destroyed, was very burdensome, and called for speedy acting. I know not whether I shall be ever able to write to you again. Perhaps some friends that I leave behind me here may, and then they will tell you of all our difficulties. It is hard to leave my dear friends and children, my wife and little babe; but duty obliges me to go; I have no time to say any more; what I have written has been in great hurry. Pray pardon my abruptness. If I never see you, or write more, let me assure <i>you of my love</i>. I hope I need not now use any arguments to persuade you to come over. Farewel, farewel, farewel.</p>

  <p class="align_chaphd">
    From <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Habersham</i>, at <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    <i>My dear Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> WROTE you the <abbr
      title="fourth">4th</abbr>, <abbr
      title="eleventh">11th</abbr>, and <abbr
      title="fourteenth">14th</abbr>
    instant. Doubtless the contents of my letters will give you some concern, and will be a means of hastening you over to us. I hope you will find us at our desired habitation. Hitherto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    seems to be on our side, and fights our battles. News is lately come from the General, that the <i>Spaniards</i> have moved off in great confusion; but it is not sufficiently confirmed; when it is, we purpose moving to <i>Bethesda</i>. In mine of the <abbr
      title="eleventh">11th</abbr>
    instant, I informed you, according to my knowledge of the state of your family, and the colony till that time. I told
    <a id="p458"></a>you brother <i>Grant</i> and self were just returning to <i>Georgia</i>. We soon got there, and found our goods and house safe. <i>John Goldwire</i>, I, and a boy, staid at <i>Bethesda</i> while brother <i>Grant</i> went to <i>Carolina</i>, and returned with two boats. In the mean time we heard the General had engaged twice with a party of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and killed and taken one hundred and fifty of them, and that the enemy was so intimidated, and the General’s army so encouraged, that there was great expectations that the <i>Spaniards</i> would soon be drove off the island. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased at this time to bring me very low by bodily illness, so that I was almost incapable of making any escape, if the enemy had been suffered to come upon us, having a hundred miles to ride through bad swamps, to my friends in <i>Carolina</i>. Likewise there was no one there, nor at <i>Savannah</i>, to give me any relief.</p>
  <p>
    The <abbr title="twentieth">20th</abbr> instant, having left three people at <i>Bethesda</i>, and our family wanting necessaries at <i>Carolina</i>, brother <i>Grant</i> and I returned with most of our goods. When we now left <i>Bethesda</i>, we were not very apprehensive of any danger of staying ourselves, or leaving the goods there; but as I was obliged to seek for some assistance, and our dear people wanted things we had there, we thought it was but a very little more trouble to load the boats. I have many times intended to write to you since I came here, but was not able conveniently till to day, but I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    I feel myself much better in health. As far as I can learn, the General has behaved himself exceeding well, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has wonderfully ordered things for him, contrary, I believe, to his own and others expectations. His clemency to the <i>Spanish</i> prisoners, his confidence, prudence, and courage throughout the whole affair is so conspicuous, that his greatest enemies cannot impeach his conduct. I don’t as yet hear, that he has lost (except by accident) above three or four men. Indeed the hand of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been evidently against the boasting enemy. Some say near fifty vessels set out at first to invade us, but in their passage, which is usually run in a week or ten days, they were fifty days, and by some means fifteen of them were separated from the rest, and did not come up to them at <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s. They first proposed to land in <i>Carolina</i>, and cause an insurrection among the negroes; to that end they brought a number of negroes, to head and persuade
    <a id="p459"></a>our negroes (I suppose) to revolt. But being so long on their passage, they wanted water, and were obliged to put in at <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Simon</i>’s. In their council of war there, they said they would soon cut off the General and his few men, and did not doubt but to settle and regain King <i>Philip</i>’s dominions, yea, even as far as the Capes of <i>Virginia</i>. I should have wished you had been present when we consulted about fleeing for our lives; it would have been great satisfaction to us all; but I am of opinion, you would not have staid with the great troop of little ones, under the apprehension of so much danger. I have met with none but what have approved of what we did.</p>
  <p>
    Every one, I believe, are willing to contract expences.—I hope, nay I am assured, that all things shall work together for good; and I am of opinion, we shall all have reason to bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for every, yea, especially for his late awful dispensation.—The deliverances we have had are many and wonderful, and he that has done much can do more. In regard to the <i>Spaniards</i>, they came like a flood, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> can save by few as well as by many.</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    we have reason to conclude the <i>Spaniards</i> have entirely left the colony, and we are now very comfortably settled again. The deliverance the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has wrought for us by the General, I think is the most remarkable I ever heard or read of, except some instances recorded in the Old Testament. It is so manifest, that “Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has fought our battles,” is in the mouth of every one, whatever may be in their hearts. I cannot now mention particulars, being much streightened for time; at <i>Savannah</i> the poor people are almost all sick; four have been cut off. At <i>Frederica</i> likewise, and at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Bryan</i>’s, and other neighbours, they are in the same condition. We have also many down. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been chastising us with whips, but now seems to be scourging us with scorpions. O that the
    <a id="p460"></a>goodness and patience of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may lead us to repentance! We have a good crop on the ground, and have none to gather it in but the few boys. Brother <i>Hunter</i> has his hands full, and is chiefly at <i>Savannah</i>. It is but little we buy abroad.—We hunt and kill our own stock, and have potatoes and corn enough of our own. I am but poorly, as is dear brother <i>Barber</i>, who is singularly useful at this trying time.—What should I have done without him? I have much to say to you. Indeed I hope you are now in your passage to us. We cannot but expect you. <i>B. Grant</i> hurries me to conclude.

It was natural to think, that as the government intended this province for the refuge and support of many of our poor countrymen, that numbers of such adventurers must necessarily be taken off, by being exposed to the hardships which unavoidably attend a new settlement. I thought it therefore a noble design in general, to erect a house for fatherless children. And believing such a provision for orphans would be some inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the design, when mentioned to me by my friend, and was resolved, in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to prosecute it with all my might. This was mentioned to the honourable the trustees. They took it kindly at my hands; and as I then began to be pretty popular at <i>Bristol</i>, and elsewhere, they wrote to the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Bath</i> and <i>Wells</i>, for leave for me to preach a charity-sermon on this occasion in the abbey-church. This was granted, and I accordingly began immediately to compose a suitable discourse: but knowing my first stay at <i>Georgia</i> would be but short, on account of my returning again to take priests orders, I thought it most prudent, first to go and see for myself, and defer prosecuting the scheme till I came home: because I could then be better able to judge, whether the scheme was practicable, and consequently could
    <a id="p464"></a>be able to recommend it with the greater earnestness. When I came to <i>Georgia</i>, I found many poor orphans, who though taken notice of by the honourable trustees, yet through the neglect of persons that acted under them, were in miserable circumstances. For want of a house to breed them up in, the poor little ones were tabled out here and there, and besides the hurt they received by bad examples, forgot at home what they learnt at school. Others were at hard services, and likely to have no education at all. Upon seeing this, and finding that his majesty and parliament had the interest of this colony much at heart, I thought I could not better shew my regard to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and my country, than by getting a house and land for these children, where they might learn to labour, read, and write, and at the same time be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Accordingly, at my return to <i>England</i> in the year 1738, to take priest orders, I applied to the honourable society for a grant of five-hundred acres of land, and laid myself under an obligation to build a house upon it, and to receive from time to time, as many orphans as the land and stock would maintain. As I had always acted like a clergyman of the church of <i>England</i>, having preached in many of the <i>London</i> churches, and as I had but a few months before collected near a thousand pounds <i>Sterling</i>, for the children belonging to the charity-schools in <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>; it was natural to think, that I might now have the use at least of some of these churches to preach in, for the orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed to my care. But by the time I had taken priests orders, the spirit of the clergy began to be much imbittered. Churches were gradually denied to me. And I must let this good design drop, and thousands (I might add ten thousands) go without hearing the word of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    or preach in the fields. Indeed two churches, one in <i>London</i> (<i>Spittle-fields</i>) and one in <i>Bristol</i> (<abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    <i>Philip</i>’s and <i>Jacob</i>) were lent me upon this occasion; but those were all. However, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    kept me from being discouraged. I collected for the Orphan-house in <i>Moorfields</i>, two and fifty pounds one sabbath-day morning; twenty-two pounds of which was in copper. It would have rejoiced your heart to see the people give; they offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd and put their contributions
    <a id="p465"></a>into my hat, than some would to have gotten them. Thousands of prayers were put up with the alms that were given, and I trust both went up as a memorial before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    In the afternoon I collected again at <i>Kennington-Common</i>, and continued to do so at most of the places where I preached. Besides this, two or three of the <i>Bishops</i>, and several persons of distinction contributed; till at length, having about a thousand and ten pounds, I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to <i>Georgia</i>. At that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I chose to take over only a surgeon, and a few more of both sexes, that I thought would be useful in carrying on my design. These chearfully embarked with me, desiring nothing for their pains, but food and raiment. My dear fellow-traveller, <i>William Seward</i>, <abbr
      title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
    also joined with them, and was particularly useful to me on this occasion. Our first voyage was to <i>Philadelphia</i>, where I was willing to go for the sake of laying in provision. Having a Captain of a ship with me, who had been my spiritual child, by his advice, I laid out in <i>London</i> a good part of the thousand pounds for goods; and by his care and that of my other fellow-travellers, without any trouble to myself, got as much by them at <i>Philadelphia</i> as nearly defrayed the family’s expence of coming over. Here <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blessed my ministry daily, and begun that work in <i>Philadelphia</i>, which, I am persuaded, will be remembered through the ages of eternity. <i>January</i> following, 1739, I met my family at <i>Georgia</i>, and being unwilling to lose any time, I hired a large house, and took in all the Orphans I could find in the colony. A great many also of the town’s children came to school <i>gratis</i>, and many poor people who could not maintain their children, upon application, had leave given them to send their little ones for a month or two, or more, as they could spare them, till at length my family consisted of between sixty and seventy. Most of the orphans were in poor case; and three or four almost eaten up with lice. I likewise erected an <i>Infirmary</i>, in which many sick people were cured and taken care of <i>gratis</i>. I have now by me a list of upwards of a hundred and thirty patients, who were under the Surgeon’s hands, exclusive of my own private family. This Surgeon I furnished with all proper drugs and utensils, which put me to no small expence; and this was still increased
    <a id="p466"></a>by clearing land, buying stock, and building a large dwelling-house, sixty-feet by forty, and out-houses, commodious for a large family to live in. Sometimes (labourers and all) I have had a hundred and twenty to provide for daily. My friends, as well as myself, seemed to have particular courage and faith given us for the season; and we went on chearfully, believing that He for whose sake we began, would enable us to finish this good work. About <i>March</i> I began the great house, having only about one hundred and fifty pounds in cash. I called it <i>Bethesda</i>, because I hoped it would be a house of mercy to many souls. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we have not been disappointed of our hope; it has proved a house of mercy indeed to many. Several of our labourers, as well as visitors, have (in a judgment of charity) been born of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    here, and given evident proofs of it, by bringing forth the fruits of the spirit. Many boys have been put out to trades, and many girls put out to service. I had pleasure the other day, of seeing three boys work at the house in which they were bred, one of them out of his time, a journeyman, and the others serving under their masters. One that I brought from <i>New-England</i> is handsomely settled in <i>Carolina</i>, and another from <i>Philadelphia</i> is married, and lives very comfortably at <i>Savannah</i>. How so large a family has been supported in such a colony, without any visible fund, is wonderful! I am surprized when I look back, and see, how for these six years last past, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has spread a table in the wilderness for so many persons. Were all the particular providences that have attended this work recorded, perhaps they would be found not inferior to those mentioned by Professor <i>Franck</i>, in his <i>Pietas Hallensis</i>, whose memory is very precious to me, and whose example has a thousand times been blessed to strengthen and encourage me in the carrying on this enterprize. My being detained so long in <i>England</i>, has been a little detrimental to me, my friends not knowing so well how to act, because they expected to see me daily. And I cannot yet say that I have surmounted the first year’s expence, which indeed was very great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my friends have had so many years experience in the colony. However, I doubt not, but by the blessing of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in a short time to pay off my arrears, and then the family will be maintained at a small expence. My standing
    <a id="p467"></a>annual charges are now but trifling to what they have been; and my friends have raised an annual subscription sufficient for discharging it, till the family may be able to provide for itself. This, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope will be, in a good measure, speedily effected. We have lately begun to use the plow; and next year I hope to have many acres of good oats and barley. We have near twenty sheep and lambs, fifty head of cattle, and seven horses. We hope to kill a thousand weight of pork this season. Our garden, which is very beautiful, furnishes us with all sorts of greens, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    We have plenty of milk, eggs, poultry, and make a good deal of butter weekly. A great quantity of wool and cotton has been given me, and we hope to have sufficient spun and wove for the next winter’s cloathing. If the vines hit, we may expect two or three hogsheads of wine out of the vineyard. The family now consists of twenty-six persons. Two of the orphan boys are blind, one is little better than an idiot. But notwithstanding, they are useful in the family, one in the field, and the other in the kitchen. I have two women to take care of the houshold work, and three men and two boys employed about the plantation and cattle. A sett of <i>Dutch</i> servants has been lately sent over: the magistrates were pleased to give me two; and I took in a poor old widow, aged near seventy, whom no body else cared to have. A valuable young man from <i>New-England</i> is my school-master, and in my absence performs duty in the family. Sabbath-days the grown people attend public worship at <i>Savannah</i>, or at <i>White-bluff</i>, a village near <i>Bethesda</i>, where a <i>Dutch</i> minister officiates. My dear friends who have hitherto been my assistants, being married and having three or four children, thought it best, as most suitable to the institution, to remove: <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably settled at <i>Savannah</i> and elsewhere: we frequently write to and hear from one another. I need not trouble you with the order of our family. It is pretty near the same as usual, and I do not think to make any material alteration for some time. Many have applied to me to take in their children as boarders, and erect a public school: but I have not yet determined. It is certain such a school would be exceedingly useful in this part of the world, if there should be a peace, not only for these northern parts of the colony, but also for
    <a id="p468"></a>the more southern parts of <i>Carolina</i>, <i>Purisburgh</i>, and <i>Frederica</i>, where are many fine youths. I have been prevailed on to take one from <i>Frederica</i>, and another from <i>Purisburgh</i>, and it may be shall admit more. For the present, considering the situation of affairs, I think it most prudent to go on making what improvements I can on the plantation, and shall bring a tutor with me from the northward in the fall, to teach a few youths the languages, and enlarge the family, when affairs are more settled. The house is a noble commodious building, and every thing well adapted for bringing up youth. Here is land to employ them in exercising their bodies, and to keep them from idleness out of school hours. Here are none of the temptations to debauch their tender minds, which are common to more populous countries, or in places where children must necessarily be brought up with negroes. What <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    intends to do with the colony is not for me to enquire: secret things belong to him. It has hitherto been wonderfully preserved, and the Orphan-house, like the burning bush, has flourished unconsumed. In fine, the government has, no doubt, its welfare much at heart: and, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I intend to carry on my design till I see the colony sink or swim. The money that has been expended on the Orphan-house, and Orphan-house family, has been of vast service to this northern part of the colony. And though it has been greatly detrimental to my own private interest, yet I do not repent of the undertaking. No, I rejoice in it daily, and hope yet to see many more souls born unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    here. I have had a very comfortable winter. The people of <i>Savannah</i>, having no minister till lately, gladly accepted my labours; and at <i>Frederica</i>, the gentlemen and soldiers of General <a
      href="#n_41">♦</a><i>Oglethorpe</i>’s
    regiment, as well as the inhabitants of that town, received me very gladly. Major <i>Horton</i> seems to behave very well; he has a very fine growing plantation. I saw barley in the ear the first of <i>March</i>. <i>Georgia</i> is very healthy. Not above one, and that a little child, has died out of our family, since it removed to <i>Bethesda</i>. I think the colony (were the inhabitants sufficiently numerous) is capable of as good improvement as any on the continent.</p>

    <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Memorial</span> <i>of</i> George Whitefield, <i>Clerk</i>,</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <span class="smcap">Sheweth</span>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT about twenty-five years ago, your memorialist, assisted by the voluntary contributions of charitable and well disposed persons, at a very great expence, and under many disadvantages, did erect a commodious house, with necessary out-buildings, suitable for the reception of orphans, and other poor and deserted children; and that with the repair of the buildings, purchase of negroes, and supporting a large orphan family for so many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve thousand pounds sterling, as appears by the accounts, which from time to time have been audited by the magistrates of <i>Savannah</i>.</p>
  <p>
    That your memorialist, since the commencement of this institution, hath had the satisfaction of finding, that by the money expended thereon, not only many poor families were assisted, and thereby kept from leaving the colony in its infant state, but also that a considerable number of poor helpless children have been trained up; who have been, and now are useful settlers in this and the other neighbouring provinces.</p>
  <p>
    That in order to render the institution aforesaid more extensively useful, your memorialist, as he perceived the colony gradually increasing, hath for some years past designed within
    <a id="p470"></a>himself, to improve the original plan, by making further provision for the education of persons of superior rank; who thereby might be qualified to serve their king, their country, and their <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    either in church or state. That he doth with inexpressible pleasure, see the present very flourishing state of the province; but with concern perceives that several gentlemen have been obliged to send their sons to the northern provinces; who would much rather have had them educated nearer home, and thereby prevent their affections being alienated from their native country, and also keep considerable sums of money from being carried out of this into other provinces.</p>
  <p>
    Your memorialist further observes, that there is no seminary for academical studies as yet founded, southward of <i>Virginia</i>; and consequently if a college could be established here (especially as the late addition of the two <i>Floridas</i> renders <i>Georgia</i> more centrical for the southern district) it would not only be highly serviceable to the rising generation of this colony, but would probably occasion many youths to be sent from the <i>British West India</i> islands and other parts. The many advantages accruing thereby to this province, must be very considerable.</p>
  <p>
    From these considerations, your memorialist is induced to believe, that the time is now approaching, when his long projected design for further serving this his beloved colony, shall be carried into execution.</p>
  <p>
    That a considerable sum of money is intended speedily to be laid out in purchasing a large number of negroes, for the further cultivation of the present Orphan-house, and other additional lands, and for the future support of a worthy able president, professors, and tutors, and other good purposes intended.</p>
  <p>
    Your memorialist therefore prays your Excellency and Honours to grant to him in trust, for the purposes aforesaid, two thousand acres of land, on the north fork of <i>Turtle River</i>, called the <i>Lesser Swamp</i>, if vacant, or where lands may be found vacant, south of the river <i>Altamaha</i>.</p>

    <a id="p473"></a>affair to a desirable issue. To mention all the various circumstances which have occurred during that interval, to impede and retard its more speedy prosecution, would be tedious and unnecessary: I would therefore only inform your Excellency, that about fifteen months ago, a memorial was delivered into the hands of the late clerk of his Majesty’s most honourable privy council. That this memorial was by him transmitted to the Lord President, and by his Lordship referred to the consideration of his Grace the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>; that by his Grace’s permission a literary correspondence ensued; but as that correspondence, and with that, the negociation itself seems at an end, I think it my duty, not only to lay an account of the whole before your Excellency in particular; but, through your Excellency’s hands, before his Majesty’s council and house of representatives of the colony of <i>Georgia</i>, together with all the other <i>American</i> colonists, and the public in general, on both sides the water, who have so liberally contributed to the promoting this design.</p>

  <p>
    That in consideration of the foregoing premises, your memorialist, in <i>December 1764</i>, presented a memorial to his Excellency the Governor, and the honourable the council of the province of <i>Georgia</i>, praying that two thousand acres of land might be granted in trust, towards carrying on the desirable end of founding a College; which motion was not only immediately complied with, but the general assembly being then sitting, an address, a copy of which is herewith also sent, was presented from them to his Excellency, expressing their unanimous and highest approbation, with a desire that his Excellency would use his endeavours to have this affair forwarded
    <a id="p475"></a>at home with all possible expedition. That upon the arrival of your Memorialist, he was informed that this address was remitted to, and laid before the Lords Commissioners for trade and plantations; and having received repeated advices, that numbers both in <i>Georgia</i> and <i>South-Carolina</i> are waiting with impatience to have their sons initiated in academical exercises; your Memorialist therefore prays, that a charter upon the plan of <i>New-Jersey</i> College may be granted; upon which your Memorialist is ready to give up his present trust, and make a free gift of all lands, negroes, goods, and chattels, which he now stands possessed of in the province of <i>Georgia</i>, for the present founding, and towards the future support of a College, to be called by the name of <i>Bethesda</i> College in the province of <i>Georgia</i>.</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> THINK myself highly honoured in the L―― P――t’s referring a late memorial to your Grace’s consideration; and as highly obliged to your Grace, for the deep attention your Grace hath given to the copy of an intended charter presented to your Grace by the E―― of <i>D――h</i>. The inclosed will shew, what an almost implicit regard hath been paid to your Grace’s wise remarks, and judicious corrections. I wish it could have been altogether implicit; but circumstances are such, (as hath been hinted to your Grace by L―― <i>D――h</i>) that I cannot, in honour and conscience, <i>oblige</i> the master of the <i>Georgia</i> College to be a member or minister of the church of <i>England</i>. Such an obligation, I am persuaded, hath greatly retarded the progress of the College of <i>New-York</i>; as on the contrary, the letter signed by your Grace, Proprietor <i>Pen</i>, and the late <abbr

That is entirely silent concerning this matter:
    <a id="p476"></a>their agreement is purely voluntary. The wardens of the College of <i>Georgia</i> will not be prohibited by charter, from following the example of the trustees of the College of <i>Philadelphia</i>. It is more than probable they will never need it. The first Master will assuredly be a clergyman of the church of <i>England</i>. By far the majority of the intended wardens, are, and always will be members of that communion; and consequently the choice of a Master will always continue to run in that channel. My heart’s desire is, that some worthy duly qualified minister of the church of <i>England</i> may be always and readily found for that grand purpose. But lest this should not always be the case, I dare not, as persons of all denominations have been contributors, confine or fetter the future electors. The monies gained by the <i>New-York</i> lotteries, for the erecting a college in <i>New-York</i>, were thrown in by persons of all religious persuasions, in confidence, that the College would hereafter be founded on an enlarged basis. And therefore, very great numbers, may it please your Grace, think, and for ever will think themselves injured, by its being confined within its present contracted boundary. Hence it
    is, that many fine promising youths are almost daily sent from the college in their native city, to that of <i>New-Jersey</i>. I dread giving the same occasion of resentment and offence: and therefore am determined to avoid it in the wording of the <i>Georgia</i> College charter. For the same reasons, I dare not enjoin the daily use of our church liturgy. I love to use it, I have fallen a martyr, in respect to bodily health, to the frequent reading it in <i>Tottenham-Court</i> chapel; and it has been constantly read twice every <i>Sunday</i> in the Orphan-house, from its first institution to this very day. The Wardens, when the power is devolved on them, may determine this point as they please; but I cannot enjoin it by charter: and have therefore, in this present draught, not only omitted the paragraph concerning public prayer, but also that concerning doctrinal articles. Perhaps your Grace may judge, that, all things considered, saying nothing about either, may be a proper medium. Your Grace further wisely observes, “That his Majesty should be very well advised, whom he names for the first Master.” I trust he will. I believe the Right Honourable the Earl of <i>D――h</i> will vouchsafe to interest himself
    <a id="p477"></a>in the choice, and likewise be so good as to present the first Master to your Grace’s approbation. The terms of <a
      id="p477a" href="#n_42">♦</a>the
    charter being not as yet settled, the choice of a Master cannot as yet be fixed upon. When the former are ascertained, the latter may more easily be applied for. In the mean while your Grace may be assured, that the lot will not fall upon me. Alas! my shoulders are too weak for the support of such an academical burden: my capacity, may it please your Grace, is by no means extensive enough for such a scholastic trust. To be a presbyter at large, is the station, which I think divine Providence hath called me to, for near these thirty years past. During that space, I trust my eye hath been in some degree single, and my views disinterested; and my highest, my only ambition, during the feeble remains of my future pilgrimage, I trust, will be this, That the last glimmerings of an expiring taper may be blessed, and owned by the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, to guide some wandering sinners to the practical knowledge of himself. I desire to bless his name, that I have been spared long enough to see the colony of the once despised <i>Georgia</i>, and the yet more despised Orphan-house, advanced to such a promising height. My honoured friend and father, good Bishop <i>Benson</i>, from his dying bed, sent me a benefaction for it of ten guineas, and poured forth his most fervent dying breathings for its future prosperity. That your Grace may yet live many years, to be happily instrumental in promoting its welfare, both spiritual and temporal, when turned into a college, is the earnest prayer of, may it please your Grace,</p>

  <p>
    <i>May it please your Grace</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">M</span>Y obligations are much increased by your Grace’s putting the last draught of the <i>Georgia</i> College so speedily into the hands of the Lord President. As by this, (I presume) it hath been honoured by your Grace’s, so I make no manner of doubt, but it will also meet with his Lordship’s approbation. In obedience to your Grace’s desire, I herewith send your Grace an account of “what present endowment, and to what value, I propose for the intended College.” Upon a moderate computation, may it please your Grace, I believe its present annual income, is between four and five hundred pounds sterling. The house is surrounded with eighteen hundred acres of land; a plan of which, and likewise of the house itself, I herein inclose, and humbly present for your Grace’s inspection. The number of negroes young and old, employed on various parts of these lands, in sawing timber, raising rice for exportation, and corn with all other kinds of provision for the family, is about thirty. Besides these, the College will be immediately possessed of two thousand acres of land near <i>Altamaha</i>, which were granted me by the Governor and Council, when I was last at <i>Georgia</i>; and a thousand acres more, left, as I am informed, by the late reverend and worthy <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Zubberbuler</i>. So that, by laying out only a thousand pounds in purchasing an additional number of negroes, and allowing another thousand for repairing the house, and building the two intended wings, the present annual income may very easily and speedily be augmented to a thousand pounds <i>per annum</i>. Out of this standing fund, may be paid the salaries of the Master, professors, tutors, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and also small exhibitions be allowed for some orphan or other poor students, who may have their tutorage and room-rent gratis, and act as servitors to those who enter commoners. What these salaries and exhibitions ought to be, may at a proper season be submitted to your Grace’s future consideration. At present, I would only further propose, that the negroe children belonging to the College, shall be instructed, in their intervals of labour, by one of the poorer students, as is done
    <a id="p479"></a>now by one of the scholars in the present Orphan-house. And I do not see why an additional provision may not likewise be made for educating and maintaining a number of <i>Indian</i> children, which, I imagine, may easily be procured from the <i>Creeks</i>, <i>Choctaws</i>, <i>Cherokees</i>, and the other neighbouring nations. Hence the whole will be a free-gift to the colony of <i>Georgia</i>: a complex extensive charity be established; and at the same time, not a single person obliged, by any public act of assembly, to pay an involuntary forced tax towards the support of a seminary, from which many of the more distant and poorer Colonist’s children cannot possibly receive any immediate advantage; and yet the whole Colony, by the christian and liberal education of a great number of its individuals, be universally benefited. Thus have I most readily, and I humbly hope, gratefully complied with your Grace’s desire, which to me is as a command. I am constrained to trespass on your Grace’s patience, whilst I congratulate your Grace on the goodness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who, amongst many other signal marks of his peculiar providence, hath honoured your Grace, in making you an happy instrument of establishing two <i>Northern-American</i> Colleges; the one at <i>New-York</i>, and the other at <i>Philadelphia</i>: and if (as I pray may be the case) your Grace should yet be made further instrumental in establishing a third College in the yet more southern, but now flourishing colony of <i>Georgia</i>, I trust it will be an additional gem in the crown, which I earnestly pray that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the righteous judge, may give your Grace in that day. In his great name, I beg leave to subscribe myself, may it please your Grace,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER earnest application to the Father of mercies for direction, I have endeavoured as in his presence, duly to consider and weigh the contents of the L―― P――t’s letter, which your Grace was so condescending as to transmit
    <a id="p481"></a>for my perusal. His L――p therein, is pleased to inform your Grace, “That he observes, that the second draught of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Whitefield</i>’s charter, differs from that of <i>New-York</i>; in not requiring the head of the College to be a member of the church of <i>England</i>, which his Lordship thinks so material a qualification, that for one, he should not be for dispensing with it. And his L――p is also of opinion, that the public prayers should not be extempore ones, but the liturgy of the church, or some part thereof, or some other settled and established form.” Thus far his L――p. And, as I profess myself to be a presbyter of the same communion with his L――p, I cannot but applaud his L――p’s zeal for, and watchfulness over, the honour of the established church. But if his L――p would be so good as to take a particular view of the point of light in which I stand, I cannot help flattering myself, but that his L――p will be so far from thinking, that being a member of the church of <i>England</i> is a qualification not to be dispensed with in the head of the intended College; that on the contrary, it ought not so much as to be mentioned, or insisted upon in the charter at all. For not to trouble your Grace with a repetition of the reasons urged against such a restraining clause, in my letter of <i>June 17</i>; I would
    beg leave further to observe to your Grace, that by far the greatest part of the Orphan-house collections and contributions came from Dissenters, not only in <i>New-England</i>, <i>New-York</i>, <i>Pensylvania</i>, <i>South-Carolina</i>, and <i>Scotland</i>, but in all probability here in <i>England</i> also. Most of these places I have visited since the several audits of the Orphan-house accompts, and acquainted with the design of turning it into a College; and likewise the address of the Council and Assembly of the province of <i>Georgia</i>, with his Excellency Governor <i>Wright</i>’s answer, highly approving and recommending the design, have been published. Being frequently asked, “Upon what bottom the intended College was to be founded;” I not only most readily and repeatedly answered, “Undoubtedly upon a <i>broad bottom</i>;” but likewise, in most of the above-mentioned places, have solemnly declared from the pulpit, that it should be upon a <i>broad bottom, and no other</i>. This, I judged, I was sufficiently warranted to do, from the known, long established, mild, and uncoercive genius of the <i>English</i> government; also from your
    <a id="p482"></a>Grace’s moderation towards protestant Dissenters; from the unconquerable attachment of the <i>Americans</i> to toleration principles, as well as from the avowed habitual feelings and sentiments of my own heart. This being the case, may it please your Grace, I would humbly appeal to his L――p, whether I can answer it to my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    my conscience, my king, my country, my constituents, and Orphan-house benefactors and contributors, both at home and abroad, to betray my trust, forfeit my word, act contrary to my own convictions, and greatly retard and prejudice the growth and progress of the intended institution, by narrowing its foundation, and thereby letting it fall upon such a bottom, as I am persuaded will give a general disgust, and most justly open the mouths of persons of all denominations against me. This, as I acquainted your Grace, in the same letter referred to above, is what I dare not do. And therefore, as your Grace by your silence seems to be like-minded with the L――d P――t; and as your Grace’s and his L――p’s influence will undoubtedly extend itself to others of his Majesty’s most Honourable Privy-Council, I would beg leave, after returning all due acknowledgments, to inform your Grace, that I intend troubling your Grace and his Lordship no more about this so long depending concern. As it hath pleased the great Head of the church in some degree to renew my bodily strength, I purpose now to renew my feeble efforts, and turn the charity into a more generous, and consequently into a more extensively useful channel. If I know any thing of my own heart, I have no ambition to be looked upon at present, or remembered for the future, as a founder of a college; but I would fain, may it please your Grace, act the part of an honest man, a disinterested minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and a truly catholic, moderate presbyter of the church of <i>England</i>. In this way, and in this only, can I hope for a continued heart-felt enjoyment of that peace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    which passeth all understanding, whilst here on earth, and be thereby prepared to stand with humble boldness before the awful, impartial tribunal of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls at the great day.

      id="p484a" href="#n_43" class="anchor">¹</a>
    of <i>Philadelphia</i> was constituted a public academy, as well as charitable school, for some time before its present college charter was granted by the honourable proprietors of <i>Pensylvania</i> in the year 1755.</p>
  <footer>

        <a href="#p484a">¹</a> This college was originally built, above twenty-eight years ago, for a charity school and preaching place for me, and ministers of various denominations, on the bottom of the doctrinal articles of the church of <i>England</i>. The trustees, as a public and standing acknowledgment of this, have inserted a clause in their Grant, for leave for a part of the building still to be allowed for that purpose. Accordingly I preached a sermon in it, for the benefit of their charity children, when I was last at <i>Philadelphia</i>, before a very large auditory, and <abbr

    In pursuing a like plan, the present <i>Georgia</i> Orphan-house estate, which for near these three years hath been in a state of suspense, may be vigorously and properly improved, and thereby an ample and lasting provision made for the future maintenance and education of many poor, indigent, and orphan, as well as more opulent students. Proper masters likewise may now be sent over to instruct, and prepare for academical honours the many youths, who are at this time both in <i>Georgia</i> and the adjacent provinces, waiting for admission. In the mean time, a proper trust may be formed to act after my decease, or even before, with this proviso, that no opportunity shall be omitted of making fresh application for a college charter, upon a <i>broad bottom</i>, whenever those in power shall think it for the glory of <span

    and the interest of their king and country to grant the same. And thus, may it please your Excellency, my beloved <i>Bethesda</i> will not only be continued as a house of

    And the three grants, together amounting to 2000 acres of land, for the endowment of a college, are thus expressed: “To have and to hold the said tract of one thousand acres of land, and all and singular other the premises hereby granted, with the appurtenances, unto the said <i>George Whitefield</i>, his heirs and assigns for ever, in free and common soccage: <i>In trust for the endowment of a college in our said province</i>,—he the said <i>George Whitefield</i>, his heirs and assigns, yielding and paying, <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN I consider where I stand, and before whom I am about to speak, no wonder that previous to my rising, a trembling seized my limbs; and now, when risen, a throbbing seizes my heart, and as a consequence of both, shame and confusion cover my face. For what am I? (a poor <i>unlettered orphan</i>, unlearned almost in the very rudiments of my mother tongue, and totally unskilled in the persuasive arts of speaking) that I should be called to speak before such a venerable, august assembly, as is this day convened under <i>Bethesda</i>’s roof. But when I reflect, that I stand up at your command, Reverend Sir, to whom, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I owe my little all, and when I further reflect on the well-known candour of those that compose this venerable, august assembly, my trembling begins to abate, my throbbing ceases, and a gleam of hope breaks in, that the tongue of the stammerer will in some degree be able to speak plain. But where shall I begin, and how shall I express the various emotions, that within the space of the last hour have alternately agitated and affected my soul? If the eye, as I have been taught to think, is the looking-glass of the soul; and if the outward gestures, and earnest attention, are indications and expressive of the inward commotions and dispositions of the human heart, then a heart-felt complacency and joy hath possessed the souls of many in this assembly, whilst the reverend Founder hath been giving from the pulpit such a clear, succinct, and yet withal affecting account of the rise and progress of this Orphan-house academy, and of the low estate of this now flourishing colony, when the first brick of this edifice was laid. All hail that happy day! which we now commemorate, when about thirty-two years ago, in faith and fervent prayer, the first brick of this edifice was laid. Many destitute orphans were soon taken in, and without any visible fund, in the dearest part of his Majesty’s dominions, more than fifty labourers were employed,
    <a id="p502"></a>and honourably paid, and a large orphan-family, for these many years, hath been supported, cloathed, and brought up in the nurture and admonition of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    O could these walls speak! could every chamber, every corner of this fabric speak! what agonizing supplications, what inwrought energetic prayers would they tell us they had been witness to, and also of the blessed fruits, of which we are now partakers. Behold! a once infant, deserted, despised colony, not only lifting up its drooping head, and in some degree over-topping, at least for trade, and increase and extent of commerce, vying with some of its neighbouring provinces. Behold the once despised institution! (the very existence of which was for many years denied) through the indefatigable industry, unparalleled disinterestedness, and unwearied perseverance of its reverend Founder, expanding and stretching its wings, not only to receive a larger number of helpless orphans like myself, but to nurse and cherish many of the present rising generation, training them up to be ornaments both in church and state. For ever adored be that Providence, that power and goodness, which hath brought matters to such a desirable and long expected issue! Thanks, thanks be rendered to <i>your Excellency</i>, for the countenance you have always given to this beneficial plan, for laying the first brick of yonder wings this time twelvemonth, and for the favour of your company on this our anniversary. Thanks to you, <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> President</i><a
      id="p502a" href="#n_48" class="anchor">¹</a>,
    who have long been a fellow-helper in this important work, and have now the pleasure of seeing the fruit of all your labours. Thanks to the <i>Gentlemen of his Majesty’s Honourable Council</i>, and to the <i>Members of the General Assembly</i>, who so warmly recommended the utility of this institution. Thanks to you, Sir, who first opened it by preaching. Thanks to you, who left your native country, and without fee and reward have for many years laboured and watched over us in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Thanks to all who have this day honoured us with your presence. And above all, thanks, more than an orphan tongue can utter, or orphan hearts conceive, be, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    rendered unto you, most honoured Sir, who have been so happily instrumental, in the hands of a never-failing <span

  <p class="quobrk in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">M</span>ONDAY last being the anniversary of laying the foundation of the Orphan-house, the new and very decent chapel lately erected there was opened. On this solemnity his Excellency the Governor, many of the Gentlemen of the Council, and a very great number of the principal inhabitants of the province, were present. The company being seated in the chapel, and the orphan children having sung a short hymn, the following address, with great propriety, and to the universal satisfaction of the audience, was delivered by <i>Peter Edwards</i>, one of the orphans:</p>
  <p class="vm_stanza ml_20 in_00">
    “<i>May it please your Excellency,<br>
    Reverend Gentlemen,<br>
    Gentlemen and Ladies</i>,</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    In obedience to the commands of my superiors, and relying also on the candour and benevolence of your Excellency and this polite and respectable company, I beg leave, with all humility, to make this public address. It may not be improper to mention, that on this day, thirty-two years ago, the foundation of this house was laid by the reverend Founder, whose death <i>we orphans in particular</i> cannot sufficiently lament; that also on this day, two years past, your Excellency honoured this place with your presence, and condescended to lay the foundation of the two wings, superadded to the Orphan-house, for the accommodation of young gentlemen intended to be educated in academical learning, to enable them to move in a superior sphere of life; and we are now met to open and solemnly dedicate this new and convenient chapel to the service of our God and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    The many and great advantages accruing from the establishment of public schools in every government, is obvious, and in a young province, as this is, it must be of the highest importance to its future prosperity and welfare, which is the professed design of this charitable institution; an institution evidently calculated to promote the happiness of society, by providing for, and instructing such poor children, as would otherwise, in all appearance,
    <a id="p504"></a>be brought up in ignorance, and become of little use and value to mankind. They are <i>here</i> early taught their duty to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and their country, and the respect they owe to those in authority over them. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has various, and to us unthought-of ways, which we poor short-sighted beings cannot fathom, to effect his purposes; but I hope I may be allowed to say, that, in all human probability, great might have been the blessing to this noble undertaking, had it pleased divine Providence to have prolonged the valuable life of the deceased Founder: but he is now no more. We have, however, no doubt of the great Father of the fatherless supplying his loss; and that your Excellency, and all well-disposed persons, especially the good people of this province, will espouse our cause, and promote our welfare. Agreeable to the plan of our deceased Benefactor, an Academy is now <i>begun</i> to be superadded to the Orphan-house, and gentlemen of this province will have an opportunity of educating their sons under their immediate inspection, and will not be under the necessity of sending them at a great distance for that purpose, or be constantly labouring under the painful anxiety of knowing of their health and welfare, besides being probably at a greater and more uncertain expence.</p>
  <p>
    The utility of this, it is humbly presumed, wants no recommendation: it is natural to love the place where we received our education, and passed our first years. If parents would therefore have the pleasure of seeing the daily progress their children make in knowledge; if they desire they should love and revere them, and have a peculiar regard for the place of their nativity; if they would preserve them from the improper liberties they may take, when removed from their authority; it surely must be most eligible to let them spend their early years under the shadow of their wings, and within the reach of their parental admonitions.</p>
  <p class="quobrk ml_10">
    <i>May it please your Excellency</i>,</p>
  <p>
    I have now in charge to return your Excellency, with all deference and humility, our most grateful acknowledgments for your kind patronage and countenance; and to assure your Excellency, that we do and will constantly pray for your happiness, wherever Providence may please to place you,
    <a id="p505"></a>unfeignedly wishing, that your Excellency may continually experience that heart-felt satisfaction which can only dwell in the breast of the humane and benevolent; and we are persuaded, when you return to your native country, our cause will not be forgotten by your Excellency.</p>

    has been pleased to preserve <i>your life</i> to succeed our kind Founder, and carry into execution his truly generous intentions. Your disinterested regard to promote our real welfare is well known, and therefore I shall forbear to add, only that for your happiness, and long continuance amongst us, we daily pray.</p>

  <p>
    You are happy in having parents, who have both inclination and means to pay for your education. I have none. But to you, Gentlemen, I must own my obligation for having the opportunity of an education I could not, from my situation, have expected, had not your parents enabled our worthy Executor to employ so able a Tutor, as we now have, to instruct us, and I hope we shall shew, that his assiduity, care and pains, will have the desired effect.</p>
  <p class="quobrk ml_10">
    <i>My fellow Orphans</i>,</p>
  <p>
    What shall I say to excite your gratitude? I hope the memory of our late Benefactor, who has laboured incessantly for me, for you, and many others, who have partaken of the benefit of this institution, since its first foundation, will be deeply engraven in our hearts, and remembered with the greatest reverence and gratitude. This is all we have in our power, in return for such unmerited favours, and if this, our small tribute, should be wanting, we must, we shall be justly deemed the most ungrateful to our deceased Benefactor, who encountered innumerable, uncommon, and unknown difficulties, in carrying on this institution, notwithstanding he was maligned, traduced, and persecuted, with unrelenting virulence, as a cheat, an impostor, a public robber, and as one, who, under the specious pretence of promoting a charitable design, was amassing great wealth to himself; all which he bore with an uncommon degree of patience. Let me add, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been graciously pleased to provide for you, and for me, beyond many, very many in our circumstances. We are <i>here</i> daily taught the great and fundamental truths of the gospel of the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    have plenty of the necessaries of life, and are carefully educated to qualify us to get a comfortable subsistence, and make us useful members of society. Let us therefore make a proper improvement of these mercies, and let us, my dear fellow Orphans, be thankful to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the Father of all, for them, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to his service, and by walking before him in holiness and righteousness all our days, through <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> our <span

    <i>May it please your Excellency,<br>
    Reverend Gentlemen,<br>
    Gentlemen and Ladies</i>,</p>
  <p>
    I fear I have trespassed on your patience, and humbly entreat you to pardon the poor attempt of a youth unaccustomed to speak before so respectable an audience.”</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    After this the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Edward Ellington</i>, minister of the parish of <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Bartholomew</i>, in <i>South Carolina</i>, read prayers, and preached a sermon very suitable to the occasion, from <i>Matthew</i> <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 20.
    Divine service being ended, the young gentlemen of the academy repeated several passages taken from some of the most approved <i>English</i> authors, in such a manner as appeared agreeably to engage the attention and to meet with the entire approbation of the company. Then <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Edward Langworthy</i>, their Tutor, addressed the company as follows:</p>
  <p class="quobrk ml_25 in_00">
    “<i>May it please your Excellency,<br>
    Gentlemen and Ladies</i>,</p>
  <p>
    Having observed the attention of your Excellency to the exercises of this morning, and the marks of pleasure and approbation so visible in all the Gentlemen and Ladies now present, I think it my duty, with the warmest gratitude, to acknowledge the honour your Excellency and this respectable audience have conferred on this institution. The young gentlemen that just now spoke before your Excellency, have not been long under my tuition; they are indeed <i>young</i>, and scarce initiated in the first principles of literature; however, I flatter myself that these feeble attempts will be favourably received, and that hereafter they will be enabled to exhibit something more worthy of your attention and approbation.</p>
  <p>
    It affords me the highest satisfaction, when I reflect, that divine providence hath honoured me with the care and direction of them, and I cannot but make a tender of my sincere and best respects to you, our worthy Executor, and to their worthy parents and friends, for the great confidence reposed in me. Duly sensible of the important trust committed to every preceptor, I shall, in the fear of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    do my utmost to form their tender minds, and to impress on them such principles as may tend to advance their happiness in private,
    <a id="p508"></a>as well as in public life: and I hope, from their proficiency, the Gentlemen of this province will be induced to promote with all their influence the growth and prosperity of our present undertaking.</p>
  <p>
    The strict and virtuous education of youth is a point of great consequence in every country, and those that are employed therein do certainly merit the attention and encouragement of the public in proportion to their faithfulness; for my part, I do most chearfully dedicate my whole time to this laborious work, and am determined to pursue it with the greatest assiduity and diligence, being convinced that I can in no other way do more good to the true interest of my fellow beings, or do more service to the province.</p>
  <p>
    It is undoubtedly the indispensible obligation of every one entrusted with the business of education, to satisfy the public with respect to their abilities and intentions, and therefore I hope to convince you that no pains will be spared, and no time lost, and that whatever is useful in the sciences, or ornamental in life, will <i>here</i> be inculcated both by precept and example. Authors in the several branches of knowledge will be regularly read, and the sacred scriptures constantly explained: these can bestow understanding upon all men; they are the universal logic, since none can read them without either acquiring a greater exactness of thought, or being invited to contract a greater rectitude of manners.</p>
  <p>
    Our time being so far elapsed, permit me, in the behalf of these poor Orphans, and in the name of every member concerned in this Seminary, most heartily to thank your Excellency, and all the Gentlemen and Ladies now before me, for their kind attendance on this solemnity. With sentiments of the most unfeigned gratitude we would express our sense of it, and hope for the continuance of your esteem and friendship.</p>
  <p>
    And I should be greatly wanting in respect and duty to you, Reverend Sir, and indeed justly incur the displeasure of all concerned in the management of this institution, if I did not now embrace the opportunity of returning you their and my humblest thanks for your kind and friendly assistance.</p>
  <p>
    May what you and others have done on this Anniversary, terminate in the glory of the great Head of the church, who is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    over all, blessed for evermore.”</p>
  <p class="quobrk" id="p509">
    Between the exercises of the day, the Orphan children sung several short hymns adapted to the occasion, with one of which the solemnity was closed. The company were afterward entertained with a plain and plentiful dinner in the Great Hall, and unanimously expressed their satisfaction of the proceedings of the day, and especially of the decency and order with which the whole was conducted.</p>
